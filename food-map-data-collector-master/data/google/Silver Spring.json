Warm chips, salsa and water hit the table in under 30 seconds. The salsa is good, but very middle of the road. Probably best for mixed guests. A little sauza and pepper fixed that. Margaritas as watery. Not heavy on alcohol, not too sweet, not memorable. Good. But not a go-to. After one, my wife who loves margaritas, switched to a white wine.\n\nAs for meals. Again a mixed bag. My wife ordered steak fajitas. I ordered a grilled chicken Santa Fe burrito. Her steak came out sizzling and was fantastic. Great flavor! And I.. got the wrong meal... Didn't realize until I dug into it. Instead I got the shredded chicken enchiladas. Which is probably what I should have ordered. They are are awesome. Best part is that they flame grill the entire entree at the end, including the rice. So the cheese and rice have a great crisp to them. I noted the error and they replaced this with my grilled chicken burrito. Eh, not great. I am 90% sure the ground chicken was store bought pre cooked chicken (I know, I've had it many times) just warmed up. It definitely was the exact same length and dimensions of store bought chicken. It was very wet and no grilled flavor or bark. Also, my wife's side of beans were definitely not of Mexican taste, I feel like I've had canned ones just like this before.\n\nSo, staff is amazing, the house margaritas are fine but not a go-to, salsa is the same, and some of the food is REALLY GOOD, but it seems that it really depends on what you get.
