The hummus was especially smooth (I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any hummus has smooth as this before). The beef strips resembled cured meat and was also delicious when paired with the grapes and pine nuts. Feta salad with mandarin slices and beets was also very good. We requested for the octopus to be included and it was hands down the best cooked octopus I\u2019ve eaten. It\u2019s not rubbery at all and has a perfect char on it. Of all the things we got, the only dish I would not eat again are the zucchini Patties. They had an odd flavor to them that reminded me of how ammonia or sulfur smells.\n\nThe two desserts were a molten coffee cake and apricot green yogurt. The top of the apricot dessert was extremely tart but you can take off the sorbet if you don\u2019t like tart items. The lava cake was slightly molten in the center but had excellent flavor \u2014 slightly bitter, deep coffee depth, but not too sweet.", "time": 1663683905, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Vy Huynh", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118003688450439201180/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SUmXzwNTX68fqAuFzM1_R5wH7dgpKFmOM85sn6=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "Had an amazing time at Zaytinya.

My work company had our holiday lunch gathering here recently!  The restaurant has a nice and fancy vibe, and surprisingly was packed for a weekday lunch.  Their salad bar is awesome\u2014with a huge selection of choices.  Their meats (that come around your table) is so delicious and well flavored.  In addition, staff is very friendly and attentive.  I was a little disappointed that they didn\u2019t have the chocolate cake as a dessert option for our meal, but the cheesecake with strawberry sauce was really good!", "time": 1640132243, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "RATHTHAR BENCHAPALANONT", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112687175923850016161/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5S5KQXfV0N8pgriT7yuhKLdzoIShrA31ux3SDFK=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "This place is such a gem in DC.
