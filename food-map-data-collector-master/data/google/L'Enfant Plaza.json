It used to be that all sauces were served on the side with online orders. This makes sense, because it keeps the meal from being soggy, and allows customers to choose how much of each sauce they would like to use.\n\nWithout any notice to customers, Roti unilaterally decided that all sauces will now go directly in the bowl. The online ordering system offers no option for on the side, or control over how much sauce you want. Customer service tells me this was to reduce waste. They also said I should put \"sauces on the side\" in the pickup notes.\n\nWell, I've tried that, and it didn't work. TWICE. The second time was after I complained to customer service about the first time not working. I don't blame this location -- pickup notes are not meant to be notes to the kitchen. I doubt Roti corporate trained their kitchen staff to look for notes -- they just decided everyone will get sauces directly in the bowl and like it, no consumer choice.\n\nI also tried waiting in the torturously slow line to have my meal made in-house, but they shot the sauces in the bowl so freaking fast that I still got too much. I could not tell them to stop soon enough. It seems that Roti is determined to over-dress their meals.\n\nI will not remove this one-star review until sauces on the side with online orders are restored. If you want to give customers the eco-friendly choice, do what Sweetgreen did and BUILD THAT IN TO ONLINE ORDERING. Sweetgreen took their time to test the process of offering mixed salads, and notified customers of the change. And my choices are always respected, because they did it right.
