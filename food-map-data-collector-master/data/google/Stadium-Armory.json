Kudos to them for reaching out to me after a less then ideal New Years experience. I appreciate their willingness to make it right and they delivered on that promise. I do understand that the holiday service was most likely extremely stressful and that what I experienced was due to short staff and the extra long service they made available with the 10pm seating. I am fortunate to have had another opportunity to learn what the chef and restaurant was all about and would be delighted to take friends and acquaintances to visit in the future. Thank you again to our waiter and the rest of the Little Pearl team for providing such an enjoyable evening.\n\nThe food was fine, so that\u2019s not the main reason I\u2019m writing my review. I\u2019m writing because over the overall I experience that I had during their 10pm New Years seating that I don\u2019t feel was up to the standards of Michelin star. To start, they were 25 minutes late to seat us. We had to stand in a small entranceway while we waited. Once we were seated, we went directly to the table and were not seated at the bar for drinks and appetizers like the website stated was the experience. Maybe this was because they were behind schedule, but I\u2019m not sure why the diners should be penalized for the Resturant\u2019s ineptitude. Once we were seated it was another 15 minutes to be served our first course. So it took around 45 minutes from the start of our reservation to start eating. The waiters seemed unorganized and not at the top of their game. Something just felt off for such a fine dining establishment. Maybe it was because of the holiday and this wasn\u2019t their A team. When I asked for them to take pictures of us, they seemed impatient and only took one or two of poor quality. Most resturant staff are now prepared to take photos and make an effort to do a good job and take several. Again it just felt odd. The most surprising part of the night was the midnight toast. The resturant did not do anything special. They did not stop the service to do a countdown, play music, or bring the diners together in any celebratory fashion. In fact, we were being served our dessert and my partner had to stop the waiter in order for us to countdown and do our toast. If they hadn\u2019t stopped him, he would have talked right through midnight. So in conclusion, no special menu for new years, $55 up charge (150 per person instead of $95) then on a regular night, and lackluster service.

We ordered the wings to keep us simple and leave some room for food from our next destination. I can tell you that the wings DID NOT DISAPPOINT! First I'll start by saying that the presentation was nice. They use a berbere spice (Ethiopian) which gave the wings a phenomenal taste that wasn't at all overpowering. The sauce that came with it was pinkish in color and was great, but our server brought out a cilantro lime sauce that was even better.

This place way exceeded my expectations.\n\nWe definitely will be back\n\nSome things to know:\n\nIt's an intimate place which is great because it doesn't get super loud. But if you have a big party do the place a favor and give them a heads up so they can accommodate you.\n\nThey use the qr code system to order. Once you're setup it's pretty seamless!\n\nThey add 20% service charge which frankly I'm here for. Pay living wages and that way I don't have to tip (becuase tipping culture in America started as a way to steal wages from emancipated black Americans but I digress)  I'm here for that plus it's double digit inflation just charge more, be transparent and that way I can dine guilt free!", "time": 1673715561, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "A Lessani", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113274285849464440336/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxZqVl2LECbkXZnIBhtrNXas7daW52iPau8liuzb=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "Tried the Lancaster Burger (double patty). Burger patty was okay, but not awesome. Our order came in very fast, but burger itself was warmish and the bun was just cold. Didn\u2019t feel like we are eating a fresh crispy burger. The smoked flavors didn\u2019t come through at all. I think patties could be improved a lot. Sauces tasted great though.\nI also ordered the smoky Rum cocktail and it was really really good. Five \ud83c\udf1f for the drink, 3 \ud83c\udf1f for the burger, so I give it a 4 star.\nWill go back to try different burger to see if this was one off experience because other people seem to love it!\n\nUpdate:\nWent back and tried it again. The burger was hot, juicy and tasty, curly fries were cool. I hadn\u2019t tried it at other places. They added GF bun to the menu. It means they listen and definitely on the improvement track. Burger is really really nice, but still like Red Apron\u2019s burger across the street a tad more.\nRooms for improvement: smokiness flavors do not quite come through, the burbon used in cocktails could be of better quality. Ambiance is nice but the music has room for improvement\n; one of the speakers seemed to be off.", "time": 1673666382, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Anna", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105343890631009643665/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxZrkBFOi90053IqoPWXsJu-F5i7uxBbuftjU5vpFQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "Came here for my fianc\u00e9s birthday with 5 people and everything was wonderful.

And don\u2019t sleep on the house made sodas. The chili ginger soda was refreshing with the perfect chili kick. The staff, especially Kendrick, Susie, and Ben, made us feel right at home. The vibe of the space is unique and cozy. We sat in a comfortable booth perfect for our group of 5.
