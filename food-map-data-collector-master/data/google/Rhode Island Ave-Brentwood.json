The restaurant is rather unassuming from outside, but as soon as we walked in we were warmly greeted and shown to our table.  Everyone we interacted with on the staff was very kind.  One gentlemen by the name of Rodrigo, I believe, asked what our general preferences were for Italian food and then gave great recommendations.  I noticed he was attentive to all the tables in this manner, which was really great to see.  It should be noted this is a small to average sized establishment and was moderately busy while we were there. We ordered caprese to start accompanied by Chianti and then two homemade pasta dishes (beef with noodles and lamb with noodles) for our entrees.  They also gave us homemade bread that was a perfect compliment to the caprese.  Everything was very fresh and delicious.  What may seem like rather simple dishes were distinctly flavorful and well put together.  We ordered tiramisu for dessert and while I would have like the lady fingers a little more soaked in espresso, it was still really good.

Long story short, the automation let's me place an order, confirms what I wanted, tells me the price, then places me on hold.\n\nAfter placing me hold for 2 minutes, the automated voice says, 'sorry, something went wrong with your order' and hangs up. No other explanation. By this time, I'm close by, so I pulled up and went inside to place the order.\n\nThey tell me then that Domino's stops taking pick up orders at 10pm, so they won't take my order. Obviously the register is not closed out, because delivery doesn't stop until midnight. So I'm trying to figure out, why the door is open like I can come in and place an order and why did the automated phone line waste my time? So I said, 'what your telling me is, I can order for delivery while I stand here, but have to go home and wait for you to deliver it? They said yes.
