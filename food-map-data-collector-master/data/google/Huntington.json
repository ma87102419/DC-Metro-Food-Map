I get the vege soup only (so can't speak for other items on the menu).  The soup has always been served fresh. It's served with toffu and vege meat. It's simple, relishing and satisfying. Regarding ambience, it's good for a casual laid back dinner/lunch. Staff are good people, especially the lady at the cashier counter. My fav Vietnamese restaurant so far.", "time": 1644495928, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Ryan Lynn", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111281311344230342499/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5RHxS0X2DtfK5irxtP-4-ml4hHcxD3dEQCOeXj9=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Had some quality vermicelli the other night.
