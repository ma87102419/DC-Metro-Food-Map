This spot is right up the street from me, but I called it in because they boast free delivery on orders over $15 (see attachment).  Since I knew we'd be over $15, why not save the gas?\n\nSo I called, first problem, I spoke to about three people before I could even order. No big deal, so a guy, I'm assuming he was a manager or owner of some sort asks for my order and address.  Here's what I ordered...a 12 inch Steak n Cheese and 4 wings with fries.  How much should that add up to...at most??  Maybe $15, maybe even $20?  Well check this out, I ask for my total because I was considering ordering a drink.  The guy proceeds to tell me $26!  Excuse me?  There is no delivery fee!  How in ever is it $26???  So I questioned the total given and relayed the information listed on line.  He then tells me \"that can't be right..I don't know who Andrew's Bar and Grill is we are Andrew's Restaurant...My price is right I set it\".  Once he said he would not honor the price on the site, he told me he was busy and to call another time and HUNG UP THE PHONE.\n\nWhat type of customer service is this???? I am so disappointed because this place is so close to me and they have what looks to be a nice happy hour.  But I will never support this place and you shouldn't either.  One big ripoff!

This is the quiet place in the cut that people often refer to...it's unassuming, filled with nice decor, and has good food and great drinks. If you go in a small group or order ahead, you'll probably rate this place higher than I did. We were a group of 25-30 (practically filling the whole restaurant) and called ahead but they weren't ready. Despite this we only had one server. The dishes came out really slow. The server barely checked to see if we were ok and got a few orders wrong. She was sweet but clearly not prepared for a group of our size. Luckily the food was good especially those sidewinder fries, fried green tomatoes, and Mac n cheese. So good I forgot to take photos and just dove into the food.\nGive them a try just pack your patience", "time": 1675184358, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Elena Anderson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105210236460944979932/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5Q5bvftaPlpJXp1j4ECJDLrV0SuIDzb34fzCcEJn6Y=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "10 months ago", "text": "This was a good place for Easter brunch.
