It\u2019s located at the bottom of a large apartment complex with very little signage showing you where the actual restaurant is at. You need to meet a security guard to get a temporary parking pass but from there it\u2019s a free for all to find where the restaurant is exactly at. I recommended parking at the first lot directly after the main security booth and walking through the door labeled \u2018ARCADE\u2019 which will get you in the general area but you have to wander a bit to find the place.
