When we arrived 30mins early our table was already set up and ready. The place was pretty empty on a Monday night. They had a lot of staff working though. The waiter was young and very nice. Our waiter handled a table of 9 people very well. I wish I remembered his name. Our waters were constantly refilled. However, ordering and getting our food out was a bit slow.\n\nDrinks weren\u2019t great. I personally was a little difficult about my drink order. I ordered a margarita with casamigo tequila because on the menu it said margarita, pick tequila. However what I failed to realize and the waiter failed to mention is that the list of tequila available was all the way to the right. Their top shelf was patron. So I asked for a Mojito and they gave me a mojito with dark rum, no lime and basically it tasted like just dark rum. Then I asked for that margarita with patron that I originally was going to order. Ok I was being nice but indecisive with my drinks, I apologized a lot for that.\n\nBartender walks over with an attitude. He was a much older gentleman. He questioned me on what was wrong with my drink, what did I order, how do I like my drinks. Then he reaches over me trying to take my mojito away when I told him it\u2019s fine I\u2019ll share it with someone who may like it but it\u2019s just not for me. He tried to educate me or talk down to me however you look at it, on a mojito which sure I\u2019m no bartender but out the years I\u2019ve been drinking mojitos I have never tasted one like that. This was a work dinner so my coworker took a sip and said that disgusting and NOT a mojito. No one ended up taking the mojito. My whole table seen he had an attitude with me. As I mentioned I realized I was being indecisive and I apologized over and over while I was ordering.\n\nThe whole table ordered appetizers for the whole table to share, one of each. Only appetizer I liked were the truffle fries. I ordered the Grilled Salmon and so did half my table. It smelled like fish when it all arrived. Everyone knows fresh fish does not smell. My meal looked very pretty. However it tasted really funny and was not good. Everyone else who ordered the salmon agreed. I didn\u2019t ask about other folks orders. We ordered desserts too which came out timely and smelled good but I didn\u2019t even want to taste it after my dinner.\n\nWhen I went to the restroom none of the stalls but one had toliet paper.

The meatballs tasted just like frozen meatballs that had been reheated in like a canned Ragu sauce.\n\nThe burger he ordered well done and it was medium when he got it very very pink.

I went in with some colleagues and ordered a plate of pasta. Our server was 100% unprofessional. She wasn\u2019t able to answer any single question we asked and very slow. It was 2-3 times food and drink were brought to our table while it belonged to another table. Food was a little below standard (2-3 stars for just food). Very salty though. When we were about to head out and asked for the check, the manager came in and informed us that THEY LOST THE CHECK!! I didn\u2019t expect this. We demanded that we definitely needed the receipt. He finally figured something out after a few back and forth of lossy and unprofessional reasons. I thought a messy evening was done but NO. A few hours later I got a notification that my card was charged another $22.xx OUT OF NO WHERE. We\u2019ve already left the restaurant but two extra orders were charged to my card. The next day I stopped by the restaurant again to make things right (around 12pm). The manager promised me to sort it out at that time and politely kicked me out of the restaurant. Nothing was done until that evening I had to call them again and it turned out that they have not done anything. They said I ordered 3 items when I\u2019ve only order a plate. I told them that and they finally processed the refund BUT THE AMOUNT WAS NOT CORRECT. I called them again about this and they said that they couldn\u2019t do it now because the first refund was not processed yet and now I need to wait for it to be processed and call the restaurant again when it\u2019s done to get the rest of the money. Totally a waste of time and money, plus NO APOLOGIES WHATSOEVER!! They acted like it was my fault wanting to get a refund.. well you don\u2019t want to pay for something you didn\u2019t order, didn\u2019t eat and just came out of no where, right? They even hanged up my call without saying goodbye, the waiting time for the call is extremely long, very rude, very unprofessional staff, I can\u2019t believe how this restaurant is still in business. As of now that I\u2019m writing this review, I have not received the refund yet and still waiting. AVOID AT ALL COST!!\n\nEdit Dec 15: They replied to me saying that I was fully refunded but I was not! They did refund me but the amount was not correct. I called in the restaurant a few times and they promised to refund me the rest but that never happened.

A very polite salesperson took the order and a pleasant server brought it out in five minutes. The beef ribs were thick tender and juicy and required just a littlebit of their ature sweet BBQ sauce to take it over the top. The fries were anything but spicy, but were hot and fresh with definitely some kind of seasoning on them. The sweet tea was fabulous.  Although at $33 (with base tip, military discount and tax)  the food was pricey, I will definitely come back for more ribs!", "time": 1663177438, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Richard Meddings", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112618359216900456088/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxZb8ucj44vTy_zUuHG8RppQyNacxwSeaSPVdSrJ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "6 months ago", "text": "Great BBQ, good prices, great service and a wonderful atmosphere.

Everything they offer is absolutely wonderful -- whether you're in the mood for sushi and sashimi, a cooked kitchen entree, or some combination of the two, Endo has you covered. I first visited Endo for a Saturday brunch / lunch, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that above and beyond their usual menu, they also have a special weekend combo menu (that, at least as far as I've found, isn't posted on their website)! At just ~$25 for two items, it's honestly such a steal, and the combo is a great way to sample both their incredibly fresh fish and perfectly cooked and seasoned kitchen items. I opted for the combo with their sashimi platter and salmon teriyaki and...wow...I was unbelievably impressed. My order was definitely a bit basic, but the classics are classics for a reason -- the salmon was perfectly fork tender, but still had a lovely, crispy crust along the outside and skin. The teriyaki sauce they glazed it with was a fantastic balance of sweet and salty, and the dish, while simple, sang in perfect harmony. The sashimi was the perfect complement; it came with three pieces each of ahi, salmon, and scallops, alongside a few garnishes. The fish was remarkably fresh and expertly prepared. Combined with the warm, fluffy rice, the meal was all but perfect.\n\nBeyond the incredible quality of the food -- in terms of both their ingredients and preparation -- the service was also fantastic. Our server was super friendly, welcoming us with one of the warmest smiles I've ever seen and helping us to decide what we wanted.
