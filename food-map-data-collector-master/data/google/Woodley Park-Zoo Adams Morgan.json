I came back after my walk and yeah you guessed it, two other people were there and refused to let me in.  I explained the situation above in how I made sure I would be allowed back before leaving, and they both said I was just lying.  It was a he said she said at this point, so the argument was pointless.  I should have been informed by the staff when I clarified what I was doing that if I did leave, there would be a chance that I could not get back in right away because of max capacity.
