The extraction of the marrow is a bit of an experience but the wait staff are excellent guides so don't feel shy about asking. The reward was worth it, the fatty marrow with a pinch of salt on the bread was everything.\n\nNext was the cucumber and feta salad in a gorgeous green lemon balm emulsion with chive, fennel and benne seeds. Vibrant with cool flavor, it also served as a palette cleanser from the marrow.\n\nFor our mains, we split two dishes: the burger and bucatini.\n\nThe burger with white cheddar and smoky bacon was perfectly cooked and literally dripping with indulgent flavor, and the fresh lettuce, tomato and onion added balance and texture to each bite.\n\nThe bucatini was a savory delight, with a perfectly ground and blended dry pork ragu, accented with chives, garlic chips, and and sarvechhio. It needed nothing more, a fully complete and engaging dish.\n\nWe finished the meal with the candy bar dessert, with caramel and chocolate mousse bounded by thin and crunchy shortbread. Heaven.\n\nThroughout, I sipped on a very boozy cocktail called the Ambisinistrous, with bahnez mezcal, rye, campari and foro amoro. Registers like a Boulevardier. Strong but well balanced.\n\nStaff was extremely friendly with collaborative service.\n\nRecommend highly.

Came back this morning about 1020am and the woman making drinks was quite rude. My drink was meant to have cold foam on top. First she served it without cold foam. No big deal, I asked her to please fix it. Because she had originally made the drink without cold foam, she had put extra ice in the cup. Instead of pouring the drink into a bigger cup to accommodate the cold foam, she just tried to squeeze a very thin layer on top of the already full cup (which had WAY too much ice). She had also poured my caramel drizzle over the the original drink and didnt add anymore on top of the new cold foam so it was basically lost in the drink. I tried the new drink and apart from the cold foam issue (because she tried to squeeze it in there was about 1/4 the amount thats supposed to be included) it was pretty obvious she had also forgotten the flavored syrup that was supposed to be in this drink. I get this drink 1-3 times a day, everyday. I know what its supposed to taste like. When I asked, \"is the syrup in here\" she very rudely responded \"if its listed on the sticker then its in the cup\". Crazy response but she had quite literally just missed on of the items listed on the sticker.... i ended up throwing the whole drink away because her attitude seemed very annoyed and i didnt trust her to not mess with the drink if i got it remade.

I had a very enjoyable conversation with Ernie Buruca, the bartender.  Ernie is a very good Barcologist. For those that are not aware of what a Barcologist is, it's a bartender/psychologist. I had a very pleasant conversation that went from drinks, children, adult children, politics and government. Ernie was on point the whole time. Great job Ernie. Now the food \ud83d\ude0b.  The seafood linguine was outstanding. It had more than enough seafood to compliment the linguine. It was well prepared well seasoned. It's rare that you get the good seafood - spice blend \ud83d\ude0b.  It could be considered pricey by some, but remember you get what you pay for. It is well worth it. I ordered both white wine sauce and marinara. Both were great. I also ordered two additional entrees. All was to go. If you get your food and drive 20 miles and your food hasn't dried out or gotten soggy, and is still wonderful, the you have found a gem. I will rate the other entrees later. I need a nap.\nUPDATE: Okay I had my nap from eating all that wonderful seafood. Now the veal and chicken parmigan (two separate orders), were wonderful. I have had them with the veal or chicken patty was over cooked and dry. This was not the case. The veal and chicken were moist and didn't need to be drowned in sauce as is the case when it is over cooked. There was enough sauce and cheese to accentuate the flavor of the meat.\nLastly, the presentation was outstanding. Look at the photo of seafood linguine.
