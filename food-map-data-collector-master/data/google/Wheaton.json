Very busy when I was there and having only one server was really a bad idea, unless someone called sick. The food came out fast and the service was fine with no issues. The food itself was ok, but way too high in sodium for me. I imagine all the dishes are done the same way as fish sauce is the base for most.\n\n18. Sum Tom (Papaya Salad): The salad was really good and crunchy, very refreshing and fresh. Just the fish sauce in it was a bit more than needed, its better off on the side, as we can personally control the sodium content. The peanuts and tomatoes are a nice compliment and highly recommended if you enjoy interesting salads, just avoid the fish sauce and pour it on yourself.\n\n16. Num Tok Tofu: I love the little bits of fried tofu with nice red onion and cilantro. But it was way too overloaded with fish sauce, causing extremely high sodium content. Please order it with sauce on the side, its the only way to save the dish and enjoy it. It is highly unnecessary to use that much fish sauce, its like drinking it. So if you order it, sauce on the side. Overall, crunchy tofu goodness.\n\n25. Pad Khing (Stir Fry): It is good, but again was too much sodium in it. This dish destroyed me, gave me a headache, tummy ache, and my lips were dry after eating it. Its good, don't get me wrong, but way too high in sodium and they need to cut back on that black bean paste. This dish is extremely simple, you can to go an Asian market and simple buy Fried Tofu (3.99), Woodear Mushrooms (0.99), and Lee Kum Kee Black Bean Paste (3.49) and mix it together, thats pretty much it. It needs to be eaten over rich to drown out the salt.\n\n40. Ganh Keow Whan (Green Curry): Their version of green curry is more watery than thick, they add peppers and veggies. The taste itself was not spicy at all and the taste and tangy. I got chicken and it was sliced nicely and was good, the jasmine rice was also nice and not hard, cooked more on the softer side.

Maybe that was a mistake since this is an Irish bar and grill, but nonetheless we decided to order the 16 oz. Prime rib steak. Customer service was off from the start. No one came outside to take our order so we went inside to the bar where we also were ignored for over 5 minutes but then told the waiter would take our food order outside. Luckily, we were at least given a beer since we then had a 20 minute wait. During that time, we and the folks at a table next to ours took turns going back inside to see if a waiter would come. While we waited, we noticed another table of 4 get up and leave, complaining that they had waited over 15 minutes after ordering. As they left, the waiter ran behind them and convinced them to return. Only after serving that table did the waiter come to our table to take our order. That incident alone would be enough to send even the most patient customer on their way. Perhaps that would have been the best option for us as well. Instead, we stayed and awaited our steak with anticipation; we were pretty hungry by then.  When the steak arrived, it had the biggest slab of fat I had ever seen. I would say the fat slab was almost the same size as the non-fat part...maybe 60/40. We ate the steak which was cooked appropriately, trimming off the 3+ inches of fat and leaving it on the plate. Trying to get the waiter's attention to pay is a similar story....Once we got his attention, I pointed out to the fat and said that with so much fat, we only really only got a 12 oz steak, so that is all we should pay for. The waiter noted that he would have to speak to the bartender about that. Next thing we know, the bartender barrelled to our table and proceeded to \"educate\" me about cuts of steak.  When I saw where that was going (no where), we handed him the credit card and said to just forget the $5.00 difference. He took the card still muttering as he went back inside. To my surprise, it was the bartender and not the waiter who then returned with the credit card. This time he raised his voice louder saying he took the $5.00 off and he then began pointing his hand in my face saying that next time I order a steak, it shouldn't be prime rib since it's always that fatty. I have really never seen such poor customer service all around.
