It was Instrumental Indian Flute Songs that has been added to my Spotify :)\n\nThe weekend buffet runs on Saturdays and Sundays from 11:30 AM - 2:30 PM and costs only $19. Its an absolute STEAL of a deal - I would happily pay $25 or $30 for the buffet - but don't tell the owners that :D\n\nI got in there right at opening, so was able to get some nice pics of all the buffet dishes! Here was what was on the menu when I went:\n***Lasooni Palak, Mutter Mushroom, Dal Makhani, Paneer Lababdar, Aloo Tamatar, Murgh Makhni, Tandoori Murg, & Lamb Curry*** (Definitely recommend you Google each dish to get a Really good idea of all the ingredients and what goes into them)\n\nThe first 5 dishes listed are vegetarian and the last 3 are non-veg, so there is something for everyone. I tried everything and all of the dishes were deliciousssss and 5 stars all around!\n\nIf you've been craving some North Indian cuisine where you will be treated like Royalty & enjoy a meal fit for a king or queen, Jaipur's weekend lunch buffet is the place to go!", "time": 1652186891, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Rojina Al", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103404507863075035004/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxZQvEmEpS8-wfzvDD3P25JMeAc7iqTyIxwi9DXJ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "The settings of the restaurant were very beautiful and luxurious.

Sure enough, there were onions in it! Not wanting to be a glitch customer, I ate it anyway. JC talked to the kitchen and another roll was prepared, without onions.The fries were hot and crispy when. delivered. The chicken schnnitzel was enjoyed as well.

We sat outside once again and were treated to a gorgeous sunset. Food was good and served hot. Water w/lemon slice was delivered as our server approached to take our order. Ketchup and malt vinegar were also delivered promptly. The downside? I had asked for extra lemon for my fish and did nnot receive it. Our server (not JC) never checked back to see how our meal was. I know it was busy and he was taking care of other patrons, but it would have taken 1 minute to stop by. While I wish it was haddock, our cod was very good and crisp. We love this place in our new neighborhood and will be back again and again!\n\nUPDATE December 11, 2021\nAnother meal at our favorite local restaurant. First time eating inside. Much bigger than expected. TV\u2019s on every wall. Excellent fish and chips. Served hot and crispy  good service as we\u2019ve come to expect. Seasonal specials.

(Not sure if that's where the inspiration came from for their name of the restaurant itself.)\n\nAs soon as I sat down to take a glance at the sake menu, I knew this place was serious about  the attention to detail with picking the sake and the quality of food. My personal favorite being the 'demom slayer's Wakatake Onikoroshi a Junmai Daiginjo & Dassai 23 another Junmai Daiginjo which pairs perfectly with shabu shabu in my opinion. The sake was also served perfectly chilled through a Hario ice dispenser ( glass funnel-like concoction that has ice in a separate glass so you don't dilute the sake and it's self-served). Before we could finish the first bottle Duke provided a bottle of Amabuki, a rose colored sake that was made with black rice.\n\nSo for the food, first of all, this is not an all you can eat hot pot place but focus on quality meat and seafood .For beef ribeye you have an option between choice prime, Kobe and over the top. A5 wagyu . I went for the middle of the road prime ribeye and honestly the King Kong portion of prime beef is perfect if not a little large for a single person. When we visited with the large party of 10 plus on a week day, the entire staff were very accommodating and the service was also attentive.\n\nThe edamame and sweet potato fries were favorites for my young kids while the prime beef shabu shabu was with standard Kombu broth was just perfect.

The cashier wasn\u2019t too nice, because it\u2019s was too warm in the restaurant, we couldn\u2019t eating there so we took it home. Also I just need two extra sauce she up charge for 65 cent for other places most they\u2019re not charging for a sauce, business not going to last long if you don\u2019t give a generous service, I can see why is not busy and food.
