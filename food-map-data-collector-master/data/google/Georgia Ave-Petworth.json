Then another top was over the pancakes!\n\nWhile eating, quickly came to conclusion that the bacon wasn\u2019t crispy enough for my liking. While they bagged syrup for my pancakes, they didn\u2019t put any salt and pepper for my scrambled eggs or ketchup for my hash browns. My hash browns was shaped rectangularly and tasted decent without ketchup. I did end up adding some syrup but it wasn\u2019t anything like having ketchup. My pancakes were delicious!!!!

I go here about once a month. Sometimes I get a huge serving of meats/veggies for $13. Sometimes they barely fill the container and charge me $22. Sometimes the food is fresh. Sometimes the meat is dry and the rice (rice!) has oil pooling on top.\n\nToday for lunch I got a plate of rice, veggies, and quarter chicken. Not a ton of food. Cash register read $15 (already too much). I handed the cashier $20. Then he pressed a button and the total was $22.40 and said that it wasn't enough. I asked why it was so much. No answer. I asked again. He looked out the window ignoring me. So now he has my food and my money. I gave him the extra $3 and left.\n\nIF you decide to eat here, ORDER ONLINE. Don't expect the food to be ready when you get there (it won't), but at least its harder for them to take advantage of you.", "time": 1663706889, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Hakim Tarot", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102374722135593657070/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxbRD5O72gYfCJ9zkaoiHp-Ps5TKyK1MDGeLJUyn=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "When I come here is like eating at home.

My coworker who is Dominican turned me on to the spot.  I've always frequented the restaurant with him because he can speak Spanish fluently, I don't speak the language.  I went into the location twice without him and both times, I felt disregarded as a customer and slightly disrespected!  Today, I went in and was completely neglected while the head server packed 4 to go orders in my face, (as if no one was there waiting!).  I asked, hey can someone take my order only to be told wait a minute! A minute literally turned into 15 plus minutes before my order was taken.  Completely unacceptable and bias towards BLACK women!
