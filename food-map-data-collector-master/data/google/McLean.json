My first time. This menu is intense.  There's A LOT to choose from (such as 50 diff types of specialty sandwiches,  pizzas, pastas, salads, soups, dips, milkshakes/floats etc). Luckily i dont think it hurts the business like a large menu normally does.\n\nMy one friend and I had to have the surf and turf. We love crab. I got mine with the old bay mayo on the side (im biased.  Im not a mayo fan and Luckily i asked for it on the side as it was mayo with old bay lightly sprinkled on it). The mayo  WAS TRUTHFULLY NOT needed! the melted brie made the sandwich mesh perfectly together. We got a side of italian fries...which to me were basic waffle fries. I like all kinds of french fries so i was happy with them.\n\nWe also got the italian pizza pie. It was super tasty coming from 3 picky pizza people.  We took the great pyrenees pizza and the old bay retriever pizza to go. Omg yum!\n\nMy sandwich was so big (it may have been the cider i drank at the beginning of my meal AND/OR the dalmation milkshake i had for dessert lol)...i got to take half my sandwich home. I think it tasted EVEN BETTER the next day!!!\n\nYOU CAN CUSTOMIZE your pizza/sandwich if you cant make up your mind. Extra points for supporting the lost dog and cat foundation.
