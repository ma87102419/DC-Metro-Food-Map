From making modifications to my large party to the modification for me of no sheep's milks, which ended up modifying multiple courses, this restaurant was above accommodatable and amazing. First I'd have to give a shout out to the management staff, Sarah S was so helpful and nice and has a great demeanor, and Giuseppe was also amazing and assisted us with ending our bills and making white truffle recommendations. We tried the 9 course option which everyone raved about. 1 felt if we went for the 5 course, maybe it would have been a different experience and a few did not like the citrus flavor for the lobster entree meal, but every other course was so amazing. I'd recommend for sure to add on the white truffle and gnocchi pasta course as it was the highlight of everyone's night, as was the tiramisu.

I went a couple of years ago while in DC for a conference. I had some sort of prefixed chef's tasting menu that had 7 or 8 courses, all paired with wine. it was amazing and I can't wait to go back.\nThe first course was almost too much for me to try. I usually don't eat raw meat, and the first course was a raw oyster topped with wagyu beef tartare, then topped again with caviar. While I was not used to the texture, the flavor was absolute art.\nThe seafood, meat, sides, sauces, all the way to the garnish was all masterful and delicious.\nIt took several people to create, present, and deliver the meal to the table. It was like watching a show unfold. The server was very knowledgeable about everything served and we were lucky he was also a sommelier. This made it even more interesting as he presented the wine that was served with each course.\nI can't recommend this place enough.
