We had an amazing time.  The new exhibit is a great way to immerse yourself in all the aspects surrounding the creation of the National Cultural Center and the role the Kennedys played to make it a reality, which of course, contributed to the re-designation as the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.  The Roof Terrace is a very nice restaurant with the most friendly staff and an amazing view of the DC and Virginia skylines.  The only downside is the food is overpriced, in my opinion, for what you receive. The steak I ordered was really good and the lobster mac and cheese definitely did not skimp on the lobster.  The rest of our meal was good, but not at a level commensurate with the price.  You are definitely paying for the location; so just understand that going in.  I would like to re-state the staff were all very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed.  There is a full bar, beer, and wine available.  The selection was a little small, but diverse.  One other tip, reservations are pretty much a must.  I made a reservation as soon as I purchased tickets for a show, so it was months in advance and I did not have any issues with availablility.  I have tried to make a reservation a week out before and it was booked solid; so just somethingto considerin advance of your visit.

Cool breeze off the Potomac, and a sun that wasn't set to death as has been the case lately. I decided to venture to Tony and Joe's to sit and enjoy this spender. One item on the menu tickled my fancy the most. The steamed mussels. So I ordered them. As I set to distinguish the aforementioned bivalve molluscs, I noticed an oddly familiar item lodged inside one of them. Low and behold there's a French fry peaking out of a shell as if it belonged in it! When I notified the waitress, she apologized and offered to have it remade. No ma'am. Not at all. Of a matter of fact, check please. Now I'm no expert, but it seems to me for a French fry to find it's way into the shell of a mussel some level of cross contamination had to have likely occurred. And outside of a quick apology, I do not feel the matter was appropriately recognized and resolved. Unfortunately T&J, I will not be stepping foot into your establishment again.

They removed it from the bill without us even asking and were incredibly kind. Things here are expensive, but it's the Ritz for a reason and their service is unmatched. I had no animosity towards my $20 house aged cocktail (The Frenchman) as it was potent, balanced, and served in a wonderful ambiance tucked away amidst all the action in Georgetown! While this Ritz may not scream luxury as every turn, it's in an incredible building that makes it a different adventure from the normal Ritz vibe.", "time": 1661388846, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Zach Reizner", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115123404796599096891/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5StlyZledkXWiha9LLLA8t33FgiXXv3t4KM41Z24kc=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "I went there yesterday evening for drinks an appetizers and was shown amazing service by the bartender, who I think is named Louis.

We were trying to entertain some out of town guests and after driving around in Adams Morgan for about 30 minutes trying to find parking, we decided to come to Georgetown instead. We were so relieved to find parking at a garage nearby and then just traveling on foot to see what options we had for food after 10pm. Bodega won for us. Me nor my wife couldn\u2019t pronounce the foods they had on the menu good despite the English text in captions on the menus, which was a nice touch but that didn't matter to us as we were hungry. My wife, and our two guests had yhe same thing which was basically mashed potatoes, gravy, and green beans. I had lamb chops, a scoop of mashed potatoes with gravy and that was all that came on my plate as it looked like something a five year old would yet. I was expecting an actual meal. It was delicious but I left feeling hungry still. So glad that the H\u00e4agen-Dazs was still open as I gored on some chocolate peanut butter ice cream. Overall at the Bodega, great customer service, friendly staff, including from the managers / owners who were on hand. The atmosphere was quaint, dark and intimate. Price wise for all of us it came to $148 and that included two homemade sangrias, a martini, and a bottle of Estrella Dark for me. Never had it before and it was great. For four people in Georgetown? It's Georgetown folks and let's not forget inflation. I highly reccomend for folks that's trying to entertain out of town guests or celebrating a special occasion. In our case we were celebrating our anniversary weekend, a great panel we hosted at Awesome Con at the Convention Center, and finally being able to meet and hang out with our out of town friends.
