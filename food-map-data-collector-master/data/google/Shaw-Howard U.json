Let me stop dancing around the main point here - ChurchKey's beer list rivals the best I've ever seen. This may sound hyperbolic, and maybe it is, but having been exposed to world class beer bars across the States I feel my barometer is calibrated to appreciate what this place is trying to accomplish. Anytime you have fresh IPAs from Fidens/Monkish/Other Half in the same vicinity as Side Project white labels and rare Cantillon lambics, you know you've fallen into a honey hole.\n\nThe bourbon list, though not as extensive as their beer offerings, is perfectly curated with many top tier choices. Anywhere from a Weller Antique 107 to a Michter's 20 - they truly have an incredible lineup of brown water.\n\nI can't really comment on the food as my trip was all business (alcohol only), but from what I could tell they're no slouches on the grub they serve up here.\n\nIf you are a lover of beer or bourbon or even just want a nice pint of your go-to sauce, you need to go to Church.", "time": 1676998384, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Lisa Munro", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102281063481548352138/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxakiMBCeYpx-br9vuiOG8NVmeU8afd5amwKw2Jk=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 weeks ago", "text": "Insane craft beer menu!

All this while the other Caucasian tables around us were being served and asked if they needed anything / we were ignored.\n\n3- finally after waiting for another 20 minutes, we paid the bill at the counter - only for the hostess who had been extremely rude until then to charge a mandatory 18% service charge . I\u2019m not sure if this is a rule but their service did not warrant 18% and it was not communicated ahead of time.
