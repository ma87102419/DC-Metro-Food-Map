We were in for a surprise.\n\nUpon entering a fairly empty restaurant we asked to be seated at a table with chairs rather than a booth. We were seated on one side of the restaurant literally by ourselves. Maybe their weren\u2019t tables on the other side. This wouldn\u2019t have been an issue if we weren\u2019t greeted by any wait staff. After about 15 mins we eventually asked the host to find our server.\n\nAfter going to look he came back and graciously took our drink order. About 5 minutes later our drinks were brought out by our actual waitress who was otherwise very pleasant.\n\nFood took a long time to come out and we overheard the host state that there was a 40 min wait to eat. The restaurant couldn\u2019t have been more than 15% -20% full so this was odd to hear. My best guess is there was a shortage of cooks. While waiting I used a fairly nasty looking bathroom with toilet that didn\u2019t flush.\n\nThe food itself was rather typical of this type of restaurant. The mozzarella sticks were initially delivered without marinara sauce, and my Parmesan shrimp pasta was comically served before the breadsticks was ready.

The appetizers were way overpriced and the blooming onion was burnt as well, but we kept it all the same.  The wings were not as advertised, as they were super small, and at $15.89 a plate for 10 wings, that was crazy, but still we kept them.

The \u201cmarbled\u201d steaks were both literally 1/2 fat and gristle, and the medium (I guess medium because again our waiter was not present to tell which one was which) steak was burnt on the outside.  We would have complained but the waiter, who after asking him several times for extra sauce for the burnt blooming onion, finally came with to go containers which we had not even asked for yet instead????

What threw me off after that was the supposed store manager in a Cameroon seafood shirt very loud and obnoxious. I actually witnessed him untaped a box for no reason and tape it back up I don't know what he was doing but it looked like not standard procedure. Then when he engaged me as we were talking he was eating and food was falling outta his mouth ( check the camera 10/06/22 some time between 3:30 and 6:45) I was the gentleman with the cane. The lady who took my order and the cook in the back of the house were awesome and she got my order correct. Now there was another incident with the gentleman,(the supposed manager) a woman walked in she was about 6feet beautiful African American Queen after she gave her order and she left, he made more then one unsuitable comments about her and the staff laughed. I will never spend another dollar in there for that fact because black dollars matter and every customer should be treated with some type of respect. The woman will never know but I do and it's an unforgivable thing to have  manager or whom ever he is to do that even if she never heard anything I did and quite possibly my family members or I could be next. NO I'LL SPEND MY DOLLARS ELSEWHERE AND ANYONE OF COLOR SHOULD TO. BESIDES THE FOOD I RECEIVED WAS BLAND WITH NO TASTE.", "time": 1665239636, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Z", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102976273864902945891/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxbj6gidIPqVkF0fhCuCDDhBrMNm3GIqI8jxbwNp=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "The worst place to order seafood, especially DONOT order online!

I waited 15 minutes in one of their pick up parking spots and never received my food, and was only told I wouldn't be receiving my food when I pulled around the drive thru for the second time (this was after they initially told me I'd have to come inside despite placing an online order and selecting the option to pick it up via the drive thru).\n\nI've received calls from the Store Manager and the District or Regional Manager (he was having phone issues so it was very hard to hear him) but neither of them have been helpful. One told me a refund was being processed from the corporate office and would be in my account after 7 business days. The other told me I'd have to dispute the charge with my bank. This is by far the worst fast food experience I've ever had, and we all know that's saying something.\n\nI'm trying not to hold this incident against them forever but I'm not feeling great about eating at any Taco Bell again at the moment.
