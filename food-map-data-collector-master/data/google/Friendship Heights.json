I gave this 3 stars because despite the food quality of the entrees and sides, this restaurant does have huge portions for their prices and friendly staff and service.\n\nSide note: I would recommend this restaurant for large family or friend get-togethers since when we went, there were kids running around and a group of ladies constantly screaming and squealing as they had some sort of gift opening exchange going on and were throwing their gift wrapping trash everywhere.

I have a gluten sensitivity but saw that the burrata was listed gluten-free so I asked the waiter about the flat bread.  He informed me that a hamburger bun would be substituted.  Odd but I said \"okay, that's fine but can I have it grilled or toasted?\"  He said it could only be microwaved.  My guest tried asking why a separate pan couldn't be used but I was worried about the time so I just let it go but the bread was really not good at all.\n\nThe waiter was a complete clown - he \"danced\" between tables. Then we had a problem with the check - I received the bill from a nearby table (along with their bank card) and I was already very late to get back to work.  I had informed the waiter that I was on my lunch hour and we still ended up being at the restaurant for 75 minutes and it was not even busy.  I took my dessert with me because there was not enough time to eat it there.  When I got to work, I realized it was completely sunken in the middle with the whipped cream melted.  My niece said it must have been microwaved.  I could have prepared much better food myself at home.\n\nNOTE:  This happened in January and I initially did not want to leave a bad review so I contacted the restaurant directly but was quite disappointed with the response.  The manager simply replied that they will do better and she hopes I'll visit again.  I don't expect to be comped for every complaint I make and sometimes I even keep quiet because I don't want to appear as if I'm just trying to get a freebie.  But this incident and the way it was handled makes me feel cheated.  She did say that I could visit their website to sign up for promotions.
