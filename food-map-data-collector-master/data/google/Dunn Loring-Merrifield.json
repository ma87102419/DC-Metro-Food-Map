Old Dominion Pizza in Arlington is my taste benchmark standard for excellent pizza in NOVA in my taste opinion. LDC pizza dough was totally bland and uninteresting compared to ODP\u2019s flavorful corn meal dough. LDC toppings also lacked strong flavor profile by comparison. Using the word \u201cgourmet\u201d indicates to me farm fresh, locally sourced ingredients. I would be stunned if LDC verified that.\n\nLDC beer selection is commendable. I appreciate that LDC has bottle Pilsner Urquell which is reason enough to come back. Would be a nice touch if they had Pilsner glasses. Carrot Cake icing was a bit cloying but saved by distinctly flavorful fresh black walnuts and fresh raisins in the cake. My guess as to $7.95 (let\u2019s call it 8 bucks) a slice price. Coffee was pretty good with it.\n\nThe staff was friendly, welcoming, helpful and attentive. Could not ask for better in that department. I like the light color wood square bar design having 5 bar stools with backs on 3 sides of the square. The cafe is exceptionally clean. Their pizza box should win a design award for its solid construction and the Lost Dog logo that covers the box top and includes QR code. I hope they find their dog.\n\nPizza = 1 star\n\nCarrot Cake = 3 1/2 stars\n\nThe rest of the package = 5 stars\n\nPizza really drags down the overall to 3 stars.

There's retro music playing over the speakers, cement floors, an open ceiling and the smell of frying patties filling the air. I had high hopes...\n\n...until I walked up to the counter. First off, the cashier gave us the \"stare down\" from the moment we walked through the doors. I've worked as a cashier, so I know it can be a little awkward just hanging around while customers figure out what they want, but it really started to get excessive. Like he wouldn't stop looking at us and it was maddeningly uncomfortable. When we finally did order our meals, he was very curt. Not rude, but just not friendly.\n\nAlso, interestingly enough, we were asked to leave a tip after we ordered. This isn't super unusual, I suppose, but it felt odd at a burger joint where we literally weren't helped at all by the staff. Then again, we were made so uncomfortable by the staring cashier that we were too afraid of what was going to happen to us, or our food, if we refused to leave a tip. So I suppose it worked.\n\nWe took our seats and waited for our food to arrive, which took awhile and gave us the opportunity to look at the \"burger joint\" atmosphere a little more closely. First off, everything was kind of gross. I understand it's a burger joint, so things are going to be a bit greasy, but I don't know of anyone who likes to see ketchup stains on the table and pieces of bun underneath their feet.\n\nI'll also mention that the sauce bin was pretty nasty (see the photo). Almost none of the bottles had tops on them and they were covered in old, crusty sauce. Who wants to touch that?\n\nFinally, our pager buzzed and we went up to get our food. As we were taking our last tray, I kid you not, one of the employees farted audibly, then turned and laughed at us. So that was fun...\n\nWe began our meal and I braved the gross sauce bin and tried to pour some ketchup on my burger, only to find that the bottle was empty. Pleasant.\n\nThe food itself, honestly, wasn't that bad. The fries were cold, but the burgers weren't bad. Nothing to write home about, certainly, but okay.\n\nNevertheless, the experience at the restaurant was absolutely terrible and ruined our perception of it.\n\nI'll also mention that we just about caught our deaths waiting for our food to arrive.
