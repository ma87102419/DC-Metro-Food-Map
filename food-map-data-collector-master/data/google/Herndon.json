It's like unwinding after a long week at work. This restaurant is conveniently located near an AMC theater, making it a nice choice for a quick snack before or after a movie. That's exactly what we did.\n\nMy personal experience with Thai food in Northern Virginia has been mediocre at best. And this eatery did not disappoint us. All of the dishes we ordered seemed to have a lot of brown sugar or teriyaki sauce in them. We requested level 4 of their spicy scale, which ranged from 1 to 5, with 5 being the hottest. Our dinner was as sugary as McDonald's soft serve ice cream.\n\nIf that's one of their hottest items, I can't imagine what their mild food tastes like. I'm not sure why they bother asking what level of spice I want if they're just going to smother the food in sugar. Isn't it normal to ask for spicy and get it?\n\nWe split the zebb wings and basil bomb. Wings were not bad. However, Basil Bomb was a huge letdown. We didn't like the combination of chewy squid, dry-ish shrimp, and strange sauce. It was supposed to come with fish, but none were found. On the plate, our fishing method was unsuccessful!\n\nThere was a lot of Basil leaf, as the name suggests, but for some strange reason, we didn't smell it much. You should be able to smell it from miles away based on the amount of Basil leaf on the item, but sitting 1 ft away from it, we failed; or rather, the item failed us.\n\nPerhaps the food is suitable for Caucasian tongues, but not for those from Eastern Asia.

They gave time when needed to look over the menu and were able to answer all of my questions.\n\nFood: the food itself was quite good! They started with a complementary bread basket with oil to go with it. The bread was wonderfully cooked and was a good indicator of the rest of the food.\n\nThe dolma I ordered as an appetizer (stuffed grape leaves) were cold and likely earlier in the day to be refrigerated, but their taste was great and they definitely did not taste frozen. There were four to an order which would be a nice amount for two people if that were your only appetizer choice.\n\nThe Turkish coffee was OK. The presentation was wonderful, but expect a small espresso shot sized cup thick with coffee oil as intended with a Turkish coffee.\n\nThe main course was the Tektas spicy chicken as pictured. The chicken was cooked wonderfully and juicy for a chicken thigh. The cucumber tomato celery chopped salad on the side complements the spice of the chicken well. The rice is also cooked very well and I would definitely order this dish again after trying a few other dishes here.\n\nPRICE : considering the area this restaurant is in, the prices are actually pretty good.
