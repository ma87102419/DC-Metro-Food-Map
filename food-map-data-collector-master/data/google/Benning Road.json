I ask for my bread to be toast, with everything on my sandwich - tasty like mayo - only lettuce and tomatoes & Mayo - steak taste funny- $15 gone to waste. Then they don\u2019t have no meal deals. The fries and the sandwich both was terrible. Will not go back - I will drive pass that one next time- I better not feel sick tomorrow cause the steak tasted funny af.

At the time, it was a woman and a young man at the front but the young man was helping me. My order was ready on time so he grabbed it for me and then opened it up to show me and asked me if it looked good!! I really appreciated that level of service. The pizza was delicious per usual. I really love the square crust with the slightly sweet sauce. So damn good.\n\n***Definitely be careful stepping down as you leave the front door though.
