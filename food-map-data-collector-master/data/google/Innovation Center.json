It's like unwinding after a long week at work. This restaurant is conveniently located near an AMC theater, making it a nice choice for a quick snack before or after a movie. That's exactly what we did.\n\nMy personal experience with Thai food in Northern Virginia has been mediocre at best. And this eatery did not disappoint us. All of the dishes we ordered seemed to have a lot of brown sugar or teriyaki sauce in them. We requested level 4 of their spicy scale, which ranged from 1 to 5, with 5 being the hottest. Our dinner was as sugary as McDonald's soft serve ice cream.\n\nIf that's one of their hottest items, I can't imagine what their mild food tastes like. I'm not sure why they bother asking what level of spice I want if they're just going to smother the food in sugar. Isn't it normal to ask for spicy and get it?\n\nWe split the zebb wings and basil bomb. Wings were not bad. However, Basil Bomb was a huge letdown. We didn't like the combination of chewy squid, dry-ish shrimp, and strange sauce. It was supposed to come with fish, but none were found. On the plate, our fishing method was unsuccessful!\n\nThere was a lot of Basil leaf, as the name suggests, but for some strange reason, we didn't smell it much. You should be able to smell it from miles away based on the amount of Basil leaf on the item, but sitting 1 ft away from it, we failed; or rather, the item failed us.\n\nPerhaps the food is suitable for Caucasian tongues, but not for those from Eastern Asia.

They were saying it doesn\u2019t compare to their mother and father\u2019s home cooking (they were Spanish ethnicity) however they said it is good. Service was good.. but I will say one thing. While one of the kids was going to get napkins, she said an employee asked her \u201cDo you know him?\u201d Referring to me. She said she just ignored the employee. I guess the employees were \u201clooking out\u201d for the kids, since the kids looked really younger (they were ages 7-12) and most were female.. but the kids didn\u2019t ask for help and they didn\u2019t look like they were in danger. So why ask that? They were sweet kids who returned a $50 bill I dropped at the theatre. A lot of kids would have taken the 50 and ran.. They were talking about how they were hungry but didn\u2019t want to eat the movie theatre food SO I wanted to treat the sweeties to a nice meal as thanks! Whoever raised them did right!! Next time don\u2019t ask questions like that to someone, unless they look like they\u2019re in trouble. There are still good folks out there, believe it or not!
