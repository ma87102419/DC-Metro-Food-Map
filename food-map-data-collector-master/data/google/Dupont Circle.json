I almost always pay up to 20% on tips if not more, even when the meal wasn't up to par.  So that's why this is a little weird with me.  This gives the customer the feeling of no choice to decide if the service was ok, good, or great because you've already charged it, and if I didn't like service now I have to make a scene and ask to speak to a manager and explain to him I didn't like service and that I'd like for it to be removed.
