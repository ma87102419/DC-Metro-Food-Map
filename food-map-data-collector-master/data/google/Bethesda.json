Nonetheless, I work in this area, so I normally go to this Starbucks. I am I writing this review about my experience with a young lady named Alejandra.\n\nnote: my drink isn\u2019t really complicated. Strawberry A\u00e7a\u00ed with light lemonade, light ice, one pump of classic.\n\nWhen Alejandra proceeded to make my drink, I noticed she put mint instead of lemonade, When I mentioned to her that it was wrong her she looks at the label and throws the drink in the nearby sink. At this point, Alejandra clearly isn\u2019t having a good morning. She then remakes the drink with a cup Full of ice, I mention again that I asked for \u201clight ice\u201d Alejandra is now boiling and clearly irritated as she has to remake the drink again.\n\nI began to feel very frustrated with the experience as Alejandra is the barista making the mistake but rendering poor service. I tried speaking with Alejandra directly to let her know I wasn\u2019t pleased with the experience & that I wasn\u2019t trying to be difficult and Alejandra completely ignored me and proceeded to the next drink. I responded asking for the managers contact because it was simply too earlier for poor service.  She slides the managers card on the counter and when I asked for her name she nonchalantly responds \u201cAlejandra\u201d\n\nThe next day I went back to get my usual drink but this time I ask for someone else to make it. (I wish I knew her name) anyway, she was great, she even topped my drink with a beautiful affirmation sticker. She had no issue making my drink and it was perfect! She Really changed my mind about leaving this review.\n\nAfter that, I started ordering my drink online, and now when I receive my drink it tastes like sewage water and Alejandra is working in the Cold drink bar so I\u2019m sure she\u2019s making it. But her disposition is not rude anymore\u2026 \ud83e\udd14you know how when someone has done something shady and than they act super nice afterwards? that is how she was acting.\n\nI no longer go to this Starbucks because every time I order online my drink it tastes like sewage water and when I go in to get it, Alejandra is always there looking at me. When I order my drink in store it\u2019s fine.\n\nI tried calling to get everyone\u2019s name no I can give accurate details however Alejandra and Maddy wouldn\u2019t tell me because if \u201cprivacy\u201d which doesn\u2019t make sense as their first names are embroidered on their aprons. I also spoke with the cooperate office and they mentioned it was okay to have associates first name but they didn\u2019t have to say their last name which is understandable. Neither Maddy nor Alejandra would help with that.\n\nAlejandra remembers me because when I called asking for names and mentioned my drink she called me by name.\n\nStarbucks, please teach your employees that an experience at Starbucks can make or break someone\u2019s day. It\u2019s the experience that keeps the customer returning aside from the beverage.\n\nManagers, DO BETTER!", "time": 1658493628, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Jt Thompson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117744313816376995602/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SnWoDJRGTQg8uYPJXw5fnusGy_BpNIU8_xTftACQI=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 years ago", "text": "Great quality food.
