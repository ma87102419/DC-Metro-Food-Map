We had an amazing time.  The new exhibit is a great way to immerse yourself in all the aspects surrounding the creation of the National Cultural Center and the role the Kennedys played to make it a reality, which of course, contributed to the re-designation as the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.  The Roof Terrace is a very nice restaurant with the most friendly staff and an amazing view of the DC and Virginia skylines.  The only downside is the food is overpriced, in my opinion, for what you receive. The steak I ordered was really good and the lobster mac and cheese definitely did not skimp on the lobster.  The rest of our meal was good, but not at a level commensurate with the price.  You are definitely paying for the location; so just understand that going in.  I would like to re-state the staff were all very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed.  There is a full bar, beer, and wine available.  The selection was a little small, but diverse.  One other tip, reservations are pretty much a must.  I made a reservation as soon as I purchased tickets for a show, so it was months in advance and I did not have any issues with availablility.  I have tried to make a reservation a week out before and it was booked solid; so just somethingto considerin advance of your visit.

I was surprised to find that, unlike every other Chopt I have visited, you do not place your order with the person making your salad. You can barely even see the kitchen, actually. The store is set up for you to order on a touchscreen if you did not already order ahead. It does look like they can accommodate ordering with a cashier but only by request.\n\nThis means that you can't see how much dressing they are adding -- you just have to pick \"light/medium/heavy\" from the app or the kiosks. I have unfortunately found Chopt to be too inconsistent with this when I order in the app, so I make it a point to order in person. I will not come back to this location.", "time": 1675710981, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "olivia sanchez", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108139417995592796644/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxZNchKRNvEbZzRg3n099ViV_J7KQFnqINqidhPt=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "This place is the worst location at the DMV.

The prep was quick and the server was pleasant enough. Unfortunately that is all of the positives I can really say about the experience. The greens and cabbage were unremarkable and with no real distinction from similar salad places. The hot sauce and cilantro jalapeno vinaigrette added a much needed kick of flavor to the bowl.  The most disappointing aspect of the meal however was the paltry amount of roasted Steelhead (salmon's sustainable cousin) provided; roughly one to two ounces at best. As a whole the serving size of the salad in general was quite small compared to other eateries, if not for the quinoa I would venture to say that the salad would have been unsatisfying. With the whole meal clocking in at a whopping $13.48, I have to say that the whole meal was not worth the price tag.

We were in.\n\nWe started off with a glass of wine each, Build Your Own Mozarella bar: burrata and artichokes. For entree I ordered the Braised Beef Agnolotti del Plin; it was perfect. Melt-in-your mouth delicious!\n\nMy husband ordered the Papardelle - he loved it as well and halfway through we switched plates.\n\nPicture not included - Rosemary Bread; really good.\n\nFinished off with the  Piemontese Chocolate Gianduja Cake; chocolate ganache and hazelnuts = A MUST.\n\nThe experience may have dampened because on my reservation I had indicated outdoor dining and came with that expectation. Upon arrival the patio wasn\u2019t set up for outdoor dining, our server brought a lamp which went out within 10 min and no music outdoors. This could\u2019ve really elevated the dining experience but the food is good worth it although depending on what subjectively is considered value-for-money our bill was close to $200 after tip for the items pictured below + rosemary bread and 2 glasses of wine which was more than I expected considering the Bib Gourmand badge.\n\nEither way - if you enjoy pasta and good wine then I would recommend this place!", "time": 1659038741, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Jared Williams", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115852263671828559878/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SJwPXiA_0ZtolelcmJGeinIGOTLo-YxPClSoFTgw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "7 months ago", "text": "Simply wonderful.

Previous reviews led us to the big wooden door and the short flight of stairs down to the dimly lit bar. (there is an elevator too). We didn\u2019t try any food, but it looked amazing. Prices were appropriate for the area and the quality was high and we were pleased. We were there on a Saturday night and it was not too crowded, the vibe was chill, and they do close a little early, but they didn\u2019t rush us out.
