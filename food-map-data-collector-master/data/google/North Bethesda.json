The servers are very accommodating and friendly.\nEasy to see the market from Randolph Road and has lots of parking.\nThe food is SSSOOO FRESH and delicious. I got the  Crowder bowl and asked not to have it steamed, dressing on the side.\nI also got 2 juices, The Pink Lady, kombucha on the side and another with carrots, apples and ginger. SO FRESH and HEALTHY!!\nLove that I can pick up a few groceries along with a great lunch.\nWould have given it a 5 star but it is organic pricey. The small juice is $6.50 each and the bowl is $9.50. I asked for a few additonal things which cost $.75 extra per item. I will say the portions are big, my 5 year old and I shared the bowl.\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND for foodies!!

When I can eat in, that is. Only half the staff seems like they have any ounce of customer service left in them, but I\u2019ve worked food service (Subway specifically, at that!), I get it. I never feel too harshly toward tired or annoyed workers unless they make me feel particularly unwanted.\nOne of the positives is that they\u2019re generous with their veggies. I love olives on my subway sandwiches, and I always feel out of place asking for more, but they pile them on without hesitation, which is GREAT.\nBut buyer beware if you try to order from them through a delivery service like Uber eats or Grubhub. It\u2019s a 50/50 chance that the order will even be accepted, let alone completed. Half the times we\u2019ve ordered, they\u2019ve not confirmed it, so it automatically gets cancelled. I get it, it can get busy, especially during the dinner hours. But half the times we\u2019ve ordered?\nTonight takes the cake. The order was accepted, but Uber was having trouble finding a driver that would actually get to the restaurant, so one would be selected and drive closer for a bit, then the delivery driver would switch. Finally, after 3 drivers fail to get there, the fourth one makes it to the restaurant with 10 minutes to spare before the Subway closes. At this point it\u2019s been nearly an hour since the order was accepted. Ample time to make two sandwiches and grab a Gatorade from the cooler. Sure, they\u2019d be a bit cold, but it\u2019s fine. Suddenly, after the driver has been at the restaurant for at least 5 minutes, Subway cancels the order. No communication, just cancels.\nWhen things like this happen, once or twice, it\u2019s easy to think, \u201cmaybe there\u2019s a rush.

I have been coming to this restaurant for years. Every weekend with my wife to be more specific. I used to love this place. However this is the 3rd that we experienced something wrong with the food and horrible costumer service. I love to give good reviews to good restaurants. However we come all the way from Fairfax each weekend and it\u2019s not okay to receive this treatment. The first time that we received our food, I asked for light pasta sauce for my daughter who is only 8.  They brought pasta sauce with extra wine. It was very strong that I couldn\u2019t even eat it myself. I asked to please exchange the pasta. The manager sarcastically responded. \u201cDo you want me to bring you all the sauces for you to taste?\u201d He had such an ugly tone and attitude. We felt very uncomfortable.\nWe came back a few weeks later. The second time, I found a hair on my steak. I mentioned it to them and they told me they could remove the plate. They discounted half of the plate with an attitude again. Today 3/5/2023 We decided to give it a try. We had just gotten our food and as I\u2019m talking to my wife, I noticed her pulling out a piece of cleaning kitchen SPONGE out her mouth. We couldn\u2019t believe our eyes. The  manager came over and said \u201coh sometimes we washed  our plates with metal and plastic sponges and it was probably a piece left. They did not do anything. He said it was probably a mistake.\nI am a restaurant manager/ chef. I make sure all my employees watch and sanitize all kitchen utensils and plates. There should\u2019ve never been hair, or cleaning sponges in the food. That is no unsanitary. And what makes me extremely upset is the fact that they don\u2019t even offer an apology  or a solution to provide the best costumer service. This is not how you take care to costumers. As a guest I shouldn\u2019t have to see this kind of stuff in my lunch plate. I\u2019m very disappointing of them and Manager of how she handled this situation. At the end she offered us a new portion of fries or a free dessert. We   would not be returning because of their unprofessionalism.

The white pizza came out doughy and undercooked (we\u2019ve always had to fight over the last slice with our family, this time we took much of it home and ended up throwing it away). Two of us ordered pasta, one ordered a meat, and one ordered a fish. None of us were impressed, and we tasted each others dishes (begrudgingly afterwords..) and concurred. I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s the worst meal I\u2019ve ever had like the last reviewer, but it was certainly one of the most sub par meals I\u2019ve had at any restaurant in recent memory. The staff was very nice and eager to please albeit a bit frazzled (which we get, they are still a new place). But the food was not something I could see myself returning for even if it was a free meal. That said, giving the place three stars because I think it\u2019s unfair to totally decimate the reviews this early in the operation of any place, and because the staff was friendly. But if you are thinking about going to capture part of the Amalfi\u2019s vibe or menu, I\u2019d suggest either giving them a lot more time to figure things out or just not going,.. it was not good at all and was honestly a one star experience.", "time": 1675516848, "translated": false}]}]
