It's been several years since I went to an Olive Garden, but the food quality seems the same. Definitely less crowded than I remember. The tables have been spaced out more, but they take care to seat every other table. Most, but not all, of the staff wear masks. Looks like they still offer coloring papers for kids. The menu is much smaller, though they have added a never-ending soup and salad option, which is considered a meal in itself. Be aware that not all of their drink options may be available.\n\nThe most interesting change is the addition of a (heavy) mobile tablet to each table. The tablet has an appetizer, shortened drink, dessert, and kids menu. They have limited games available on the tablet too. Note that the tablet is used to order appetizers, which is what our server did for us. The tablet is also used to pay with card, and it has a slot in the back where you can insert your chip card. It also allows tap paying in the front. For the tip, it offers a sliding scale on screen so you can choose the percentage or amount of tip you want to leave. And finally, you can print out the receipt from the front of the tablet. Truly fascinating.\n\nService was pretty good, though a bit slower at the end. Our server seemed a bit awkward/new, but was very friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating. She was quick to offer us more portions of bread, salad, and refillable drinks without being asked. She also quickly removed empty plates for us.\n\nOne of us ordered coffee, and I was interested to see they gave us a small pot of coffee, bowl of sugar, and tiny pitcher of cream. And mug of course. Sadly forgot to take a picture. It would have been more sophisticated if the set came on a tray, but this is not that type of restaurant. \ud83d\ude1c\n\nAll of the food was very good. I was a bit so-so in realizing that practically all of their appetizers are fried, but they were all very delicious. The Spinach-Artichoke Dip was very good. Maybe a little too salty, but plenty of spinach. The breadsticks still come already salted and oiled.\n\nNote the entrees come with soup or salad (it doesn't say this on the menu, but it's true). The server still offers additional cheese with the salad and entrees. Both the Chicken Marsala and the Chicken Parmigiana were tender and moist. All the pastas perfectly cooked and the sauces delicious. I think the portion sizes have decreased a little, but that's sort of expected.\n\nAll in all, good food and good service.
