But the chicken and the sauces\u2026 those are a different story.\n\nI can understand the craze and hype about Nando\u2019s and how they franchised so quickly. I cannot even find the right words to describe it. The chicken is halal, I believe, which is why it\u2019s also a hit for our Muslim brothers. The chicken is very tender and has the right amount of flavor that will complement any sauce you choose. From mild to extremely hot, you can dip or drown the chicken in any sauces and finish it to the bones.\n\nOrdering and paying is through their website or app. Make sure you put your table number if you are dining in and they will serve your order in 10-20 minutes. You do not need to buzz your table after eating. The staff will do that for you. Hence, you need to tip. You have to get your own sauces, utensils, and fountain drink/water though.\n\nI have tried their juice as well. I think I ordered something with a pineapple orange and it is very refreshing. Sweet but refreshing.\n\nCredit cards accepted.
