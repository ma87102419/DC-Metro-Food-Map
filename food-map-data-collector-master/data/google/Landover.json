I have several issues with this place.\n\n1. The Drivers.\n\nI understand that we live in a not so good area. The drivers are scared of being robbed so they will not deliver the food to your door. Instead, they will make you come to the car and get it. And if you're not out the door about 15 seconds after they call you, the will obnoxiously blow the horn until you come outside not knowing if there is a disability that you suffer from that prohibits you from doing so. Once you get to the car, they will yell \"Give me the money\". First of all, don't tell me to give you anything. How about we great each other with hellos instead ? Today, the driver actually snatched the money out of my hand and then said something which I'm pretty sure was either a racial slur or something smart in his own language. I asked him to repeat it and he threw my items at me. I immediately called the store and asked to speak with a manager who seemed like he could careless about my complaint against his driver.\n\n2. The Portions.\n\nThe lunch portions are starting to get smaller and smaller. They're giving you more vegetables than meat in everything. A shrimp egg roll is no longer a shrimp egg roll but a egg roll with spring roll filling a baby one baby shrimp. I ordered a steak and cheese and the the bread was hot but the meat was damn near cold.\n\n3. The Lack-of-Respect.\n\nYou have a business in OUR neighborhood. Don't you think that you should show us some type of respect considering the fact that it is us who are ordering from you that pays your bills to keep your business open.\n\nI will NEVER order from here again and I hope that anyone who goggle this address for delivery reads this review and doesn't order from there either.", "time": 1509997754, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Jeffrey Begun", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107706783035800760931/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxaXfENOjZHn14Y3KFtlKNaFvkQt58CgNRl5b-lM=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "They tried to smart-alecks with my order.
