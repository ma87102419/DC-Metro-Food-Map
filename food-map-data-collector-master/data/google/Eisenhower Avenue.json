THIS is the Jimmy John's \"freaky fast\" that we all come to expect. Not to mention the sandwich itself was really good (digging the new #7). Great work Carlyle Jimmy Johns! Will not hesitate to come back here again.\n\nOLD REVIEW (sometime in 2021):\n\nThis is the slowest Jimmy John's I have experienced.. I am used to real Jimmy John's thoroughout the Midwest (Indiana, Illinois, etc.) where the sandwiches would literally be handed to you or is ready for you to pick up before you complete your payment, hence the slogan \"Freaky Fast\". That does not exist here.\n\nI waited until over a year's experience at this location before giving up and writing this review, just to make sure this experience isn't an anomalie or due to learning curve. At this location, you can count on waiting at least 3 or 4 minutes after your complete payment until your sandwich is ready. I wish I can say they are understaffed but they seem to be adequately staffed. When I visited, there were 2 people waiting at the register (nobody waiting to order), there was only one person starting the sandwich line and calling out orders (my sandwich was not called to be started until 2 minutes after I completed payment), 2 or 3  other people behind the counter (possibly on the sandwich line), and 1 person doing misc. tasks.\n\nPositive stars for staff friendliness and quality of food, both of which seem to be consistent with this location. However, the speed of service is my biggest concern with this location, especially with the high national expectation of the Jimmy John's brand.", "time": 1646244004, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Emily Curay", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108067821916051592879/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SLP0OIwL_9D8fz_YpWlW_gzBSHWaAmeNLgy9uBOg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "6 months ago", "text": "I went there today & what a terrible experience.
