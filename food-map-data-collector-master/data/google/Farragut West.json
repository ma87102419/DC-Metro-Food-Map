Definitely a must for first timers at Bombay Club!\n\nFor entrees we split the following: Lamb vindaloo, chicken biryani, chicken makhni, halibut, garlic naan, goat cheese kulcha, mint paratha, and truffle naan. I honestly didn't feel any of the main dishes stood out to me. The halibut was unique and something different, but the lamb vindaloo tasted normal, chicken biryani and chicken makhni were ok, and the different naans and parathas were also normal.

Never saw this behavior again. They have a sign posted at the front ALL are welcome. Best slice in DC for a couple reasons. $5 for basically two slices. But it's also thin crust, flavorful dough, good cheese. It doesn't need much else made this way.

May I say that the wings were delicious and still burning the corners of my mouth, lol. The fries were heavy and truly filled you up after a few.
