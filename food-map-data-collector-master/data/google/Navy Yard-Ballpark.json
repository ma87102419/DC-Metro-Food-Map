We were waiting for approximately 30 minutes before placing our order, but only a further 5 to receive what we requested. Some of the menu items were no longer available due to high demand, specifically the soft crab, but nothing else appeared to be out of stock.\n\nThe food itself was delicious and made for a mostly filling lunch. The prices were a little high for a simple pair of fish sandwiches (rockfish & flounder) as well as a side of fries, but it's an easy matter to reconcile.\n\nThe place was heaving given the large queues but we didn't struggle to find a place to sit.
