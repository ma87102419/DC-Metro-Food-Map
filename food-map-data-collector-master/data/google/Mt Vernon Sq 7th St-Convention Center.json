Let me stop dancing around the main point here - ChurchKey's beer list rivals the best I've ever seen. This may sound hyperbolic, and maybe it is, but having been exposed to world class beer bars across the States I feel my barometer is calibrated to appreciate what this place is trying to accomplish. Anytime you have fresh IPAs from Fidens/Monkish/Other Half in the same vicinity as Side Project white labels and rare Cantillon lambics, you know you've fallen into a honey hole.\n\nThe bourbon list, though not as extensive as their beer offerings, is perfectly curated with many top tier choices. Anywhere from a Weller Antique 107 to a Michter's 20 - they truly have an incredible lineup of brown water.\n\nI can't really comment on the food as my trip was all business (alcohol only), but from what I could tell they're no slouches on the grub they serve up here.\n\nIf you are a lover of beer or bourbon or even just want a nice pint of your go-to sauce, you need to go to Church.", "time": 1676998384, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Lisa Munro", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102281063481548352138/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxakiMBCeYpx-br9vuiOG8NVmeU8afd5amwKw2Jk=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 weeks ago", "text": "Insane craft beer menu!

The ambience is nice, an open dining room concept allowing you to view most of the dining room. The lights are dimmed and give a candlelight style vibe which was nice. Service for the table was spot on, the waiter was amazing, giving great wine recommendations and proper service the entire night. I started with the bang bang shrimp appetizer which was honestly, the best I've had (definitely better than Bonefish). The flavor was rich and texture was a bit more creamy with a larger shrimp size than most places serving the same app. The main course of Pan Seared Chilean Sea Bass was cooked well, the firm texture of the fish went well with the sundried tomato risotto. The mac and cheese was lackluster, it had a great velvety cheese texture but lacked the sharpness I think defines a \"good\" mac. The cheeses chosen were too mild in my opinion. The creamed spinach was good. The Lemon Crunch Cake dessert was darn tasty, not too acidic or lemony but well balanced, not a great deal of crunch but the flavors coming from the dish outshine the need for \"crunch\". Great overall experience, I would recommend going when it is not so crowded to truly enjoy your experience (some tables may be a bit close to other guest, but this is to be expected during a holiday/high volume day)", "time": 1645156453, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Gerald Brown", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110751801044168875408/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5QWtXkjkblja1M98FgH5GtjhR1gAlfwXIZgvGV9b0w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "11 months ago", "text": "Our waiter was fantastic and the food was delicious and visually appealing.
