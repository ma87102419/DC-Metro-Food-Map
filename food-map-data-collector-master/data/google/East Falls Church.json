The rice isn't even normal rice that comes with fish tacos, it's like sprouted wheat you'd find in a health food store. Very disappointed because I was looking forward to checking this place out.

The wings had good flavor and well cooked meat, but the amount of char seemed somewhat excessive especially towards the last couple. The mahi sandwich had an indescribable taste that felt neither good nor bad to me. Both the cole slaw and side salad were fresh tasting. My request for a burger medium rare without a bun had the correct temperature but seemed a little salty to me. The fries tasted inconsistent, as some of my waffle fries felt warm and appealing and others were more room temperature and even stale. I liked the key lime pie itself with a balanced tart flavor and a crust that broke easy with my spoon. As minor points, the diced mango garnish seemed unripe and the mango coulis could have been more generous compared to what shows on the menu.\n\nThe total bill amounted to a little under $65 excluding tax and tip.

The interior looked clean and inviting. Service was pleasant and friendly throughout. I ordered potato and leek soup and sausage rolls for appetizers, fish and chips, and bread pudding. Dishes arrived at appropriate times throughout my meal.\n\nThe complimentary brown bread came in two flavors, both striking me as somewhat dry (even for soda bread). The soup was smooth with a subtle potato flavor. I prefer this kind of soup to have more texture from diced potato and saut\u00e9ed leek myself, but this version was pleasing to eat nonetheless. My server recommended the mustards accompanying the sausage rolls, and she was correct in saying how the rolls taste great with either Irish yellow mustard or stone grain and stout mustard. The pastry was flaky and just a tad chewy, and the sausage had a proper European flavor and texture. Overall a good appetizer portion. The fish had a great crunch, satisfying thermal heat, and flaky texture. I sensed a slight oiliness with the outside, but I gladly finished my plate. Fries were warm and good crispiness without being oily at all. More cole slaw would have been welcome, as their version was not overdressed at all. Even the tartar sauce had some diced pickle to add some welcome acidity along with the lemon garnish. The bread pudding was soft. The amount of sauce seemed excessive to me given the portion of pudding, but I could see how others might enjoy.\n\nThe total for my meal fell between $40-$50 without tax or tip.

I'm only marking it 4/5 instead of 5/5 since I thought that the Miso soup was a bit watery.  They must be going for a more subtle taste but personally I prefer a more robust flavor.  Everything else was exceptional though.  The Futomaki had a balanced combination of ingredients and flavors.  Sushi rice can be hard to perfect, but the rice in these rolls was sweet and sticky without either quality being overpowering.  The egg was nicely spongy while still having a slight firmness.  The other sushi rolls I tried were excellent as well, and the oily, chewy fish eggs that coated one of them were a particular highlight.  My main course was a Teriyaki New York strip steak served with a side of rice and salad.  The steak was marinated in a thick layer of teriyaki and dotted with sesame seeds, and the meat itself wrapped my taste buds in a warm embrace of juicy tenderness.

The restaurant has a small dry erase board with their specialties. Since \"rice\" is in their name, you can't go wrong with ordering \"Com Tam Saigon\", which is listed as #1. The dish includes broken jasmine rice (com tam), shredded pork (bi), grilled marinated pork chop (thit nuong), steamed pork quiche (cha), a fried egg, and Chinese sausage (lap suong). The dish is a generous size and comes with a small bowl of broth with cilantro to enjoy after your meal. It was truly delicious and the pork was tender and had a bit of char. Use the fish sauce (nuoc mam) and mix it into your rice and bi. There are condiments to doctor the fish sauce to your preferred level of heat.\n\nCASH ONLY! The com tam is $9/each including tax.

The broth was delicious, but all the ingredients were straight up frozen like they pulled them from a frozen package from the nearby supermarket. The mushrooms were obviously canned as well lol. The plating was also super pretty! It was good don't get me wrong, and I know the broth is what I came for, but it's too obvious!\n\nOverall, amazing broth, but the overall experience was just okay.", "time": 1659482707, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Vicki", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110755660457140091938/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5QqHFWqOQIhFZ_1Jcn4xs-Ex84dTKOIYge9l1yZ_A=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "There is a reason that Rice Paper is always ranked one of the best restaurants in northern Virginia.
