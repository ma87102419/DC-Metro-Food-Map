I'm a paying customer, I just want to change and touch up my make up. He told me that if I wanted to do that, then I should GO HOME.

I asked who the owner was and they refused that as well. Then they said that I needed to leave or they would call the police on me. Call the police on me for what?

The sauce was too acidic from using unripe tomatoes and gave me bad heart burn. This only happens to me with bad sauce. I do not know how often they make their sauce and where they source their ingredients from but I won't be trying any other pizzas from here.\n\nExecution of cooking: it was properly cooked and the crust is perfectly crisp but lacking flavor of good dough.\n\nPresentation: not good, either it was because it is during a lunch rush although it should have been towards the end of it or the employee just doesn't care and threw pepperoni on it where are some slices don't have nearly as much as others.
