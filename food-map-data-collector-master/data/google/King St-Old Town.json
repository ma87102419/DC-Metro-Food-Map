We are more than lucky that you have found such a talented chef to run your kitchen. Chef  Pflaumer uses the freshest ingredients in a way that highlights their natural flavor and will dazzle even the most picky critics. Also, I'd like to mention our waiter, Zach. He was fantastic and was more than happy to provide us with suggestions and answers to any questions we had. He certainly did not disappoint. This is a bright, new chapter and I can't wait to see what's next. We'll definitely be going back every couple of weeks as the menu and season changes. We can't wait to see what Chef  Pflaumer treats us with next. Vermilion, just like the color it was named after, will dazzle and delight you. It's a must if you're anywhere close, or even if you're not. You must go, WILL NOT be disappointed and I promise, you will go back.\nWe revisited for a champagne and food pairing.
