Even the complementary onion and poppy seed bread was delicious, so I saved some and had it with coffee the next day.   The wine, Stag's Leap, was expensive but very smooth and rich without being heavy on the pallette and complimented our meal very well.  Service was great as well; our server seemed a little awkward but had great suggestions and was attentive while still giving my husband and me time and space to chat and enjoy the food.\nThe only, tiny thing I wasn't loving was their website stated there was a dress code so we dressed for the occasion, but it clearly was not an enforced code which made it look and feel more like a casual, everyday restaurant as opposed to fine dining, not a biggie and not taking any stars or respect from the restaurant, just an observation and a me thing.\nSo why not 5 stars?  My husband always says no one gets 5 stars; this would imply they are perfect and have nothing else to improve on.  That said, prices here were on the higher end, almost feeling over-priced.  Our table placement felt like we were in the way of restaurant traffic, not very intimate and cozy.\nOverall, I went in with low expectations and tried to hate it but couldn't and ended up enjoying the experience as a whole; we'll definitely be back!", "time": 1646453860, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Joe", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103066943425342629907/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5QG1hXJeRXZwgFXL-S9oQ50AjU2OGLxiaBCfs9KnA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "I was surprised with this restaurant for my birthday, and I enjoyed everything that we got.
