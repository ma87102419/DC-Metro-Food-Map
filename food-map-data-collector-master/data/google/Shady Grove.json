Different kinds of spices immersed in the meat, making it perfectly and uniquely flavorful. I always order this when I come. Favorite spicy appetizer.

When waiting with a baby in the tight space it made things difficult. Although there were maybe 10 to go dishes coming out. I just think they should give an accurate time if they are busier. Also some of the wine looks pretty old, with shriveled lables and some have dust. Bottles of wine seemed a little higher priced too.  Otherwise they do have a great selection of authentic Peruvian ice cream.", "time": 1639249350, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Regi Hall", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109906843177848529397/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxbAD6K6tp2KdBiuHjMXEWa_gYuYGLP7nl5mXuRO=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 weeks ago", "text": "This place is a small quaint Bodega-type restaurant.

I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect because my wife said we were coming for the seafood. After reading some reviews I was hopeful and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nOnly one of us ordered their \u201cfamous\u201d ceviche but everyone loved their food. Space is limited and even though they sell alcohol, they can\u2019t sell it to you to have on premise which was annoying but nonetheless everything was delicious.\n\nI had the arroz con mariscos and it was delicious though I wasn\u2019t expecting how spicy the rice was. If you\u2019re sensitive to spice careful about what you ordered although I think mine was an exception.\n\nDefinitely coming back to try some of the more traditional criolla dishes though \ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffc", "time": 1627654368, "translated": false}]}]
