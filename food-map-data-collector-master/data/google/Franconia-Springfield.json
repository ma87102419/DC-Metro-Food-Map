Tonight was a different story- and so bad that we will likely never return. TLDR: it took 3 hours to get our order and the pizza was inedible. See photo. Order at your own risk.\n\nWe ordered through Grubhub and our order was delayed multiple times. My husband called to check in and they said it would not take as long as Grubhub was estimating and that they were just behind because of their BOGO pizza deal on Tuesdays. BOGO pizza deal? Uhhh well we paid full price through Grubhub. The manager was shocked to learn the discount doesn\u2019t show up for Grubhub customers. First issue. My husband very politely explained how long we\u2019ve been waiting and we were offered a future free pizza. Fine.\n\nMore delays later our order is randomly cancelled via Grubhub. My husband calls again. They are shocked to learn the order was cancelled\u2026 not sure how that works but ok\u2026 so they tell him the pizzas just came out of the oven and they will give them to us for free if I want to come get it. Fine. Off I go to pick it up.\n\nI show up at the restaurant, which was empty by the way, except for a few people waiting for takeout. Come to find out our order is NOT ready. There was no presence from the manager. He came around to put some things into the POS system and never acknowledged any of the weary customers who had been waiting for hours. Never apologized, and never even appeared to have any sense of urgency to get the restaurant back on track.\n\nFinally the pizza was done and it was absolutely disgusting. The dough was practically uncooked yet the cheese was burned. We threw it away. After over 3 hours of waiting, we were left hungry.\n\nIf a pizza restaurant can\u2019t manage to make pizzas- the literal bare minimum- what else isn\u2019t being managed there? Are the employees washing their hands? Makes you wonder. We\u2019re so turned off by the ridiculous wait, poor food quality and lack of management intervention that we will likely not return.

My server continually checked in on me and wasn't the talkative type. He let me say what I needed and left it simple, which I appreciated very much. He brought me a couple things when I asked for them and was always there to help at the right time.
