My daughter even asked would I get that or a Fish Filet from McDonald's. I picked the latter. They have a lemon cake that I was tempted to get but declined. My server gave me a slice on the house right before I left. After tasting it, I'm so glad I didn't pay for it. The size is a little small and it's like they're trying to go for a key lime taste in a cake. It's just OK. I wouldn't get it again either.

As I'm waiting in the front area, I see through the kitchen door window, someone sitting on a stool laughing.

She helps the customer and then helps me.  After waiting about 20-25 min, I get my order of 6 tacos!!! I drive home and find my order is all wrong and I can't eat it.  I had to go drive back.\n\nI speak to the manager, Simon and request my order be remade.  Had to teach Simon step by step how to order on the app.  I also tell him it's your responsibility to attend to the customers in the store.  He responds we do have people in the front. I then told him the other customer who came in after me had to yell out \"HELLO!!\"  I then told him anyone can come in here and steal anything.  I also asked why is the food out in the pickup area.  He stated they no longer put it in the pick up area because food is being stolen.   Well, it's probably being stolen because no one is watching the front.\n\nThis isn't the first time I've ordered the same food here.  In the end, I wasted one hour to get 6 tacos!!   That's two round-trips!!  What a waste of my time!!   Why is this Taco bell service so slow even when there's no line in the drive thru?  It's clear,  Simon does not know how to manage this store.
