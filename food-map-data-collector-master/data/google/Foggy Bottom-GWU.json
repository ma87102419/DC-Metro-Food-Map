It's the first family trip and celebration in a restaurant since the pandemic.\n\nFirst, the atmosphere was great and the food would have been perfect if they were not bland, where we were expecting more flavors and too salty in other areas.\n\nWe appreciate how family friendly it was! They have kids menu, but I can't recall the age limit. We were warmly greeted and I thought were off on a great note.\n\nThe main server was nice and gave recommendations, but only when asked. He did not take initiative so it was a bit odd for us. The assisting servers, on the other hand, were awesome! They were very attentive (ie. Refilling glasses before it ever went empty and paying attention that I was still on sparkling water and great with the kids).\n\nSpeaking of sparkling water.... I've never been to a place that up charged it for about 1000%; no exaggeration. It was $11 for a bottle. My husband enjoyed the \"marry me honey\" drink before the meal and the red wine with the steak.\n\nI have to agree the fries were delicious! It was odd that we were not offered the garlic bread. I wouldn't have known that we could have some until I saw other tables served them and thought it was odd to have a bread plate, but not offered bread. It was only when I asked one of the assisting servers that we were served since bread, which my husband enjoyed. I, on the other hand, found that it wasn't great. I thought the idea was neat, but it was not soft as I thought it would be (like a cinnamon roll).\n\nThe table side preparation of the tuna tartare was a nice touch and it looked elegant prior to being mixed. We both felt it was underseasoned and could use a touch of citrus.\n\nI enjoyed the brussel sprouts side. The mushrooms were salty though. We requested the rib eye to be cooked medium rare, but my husband found it more rare than he'd like. The steak was also salty. The kids' meals look good, but the farmer's fruit platter appetizer for the kids looked very plain and lacked finesse. The kids did mention that the Mac and cheese was not as good as how I make it at home. Because it was considered a must try fish, we tried a bit and agreed it was really one note and tasted heavy.\n\nLastly, when I called to make reservations, I mentioned it was my husband's birthday. Someone called to confirm our reservations and his birthday and said they will make it extra special for him. We weren't expecting much, but not even a candle on the chocolate molten lava cake. We should have tried with the s'mores other Yelpers recommended as the molten lava cake was a disappointment.

The new exhibit is a great way to immerse yourself in all the aspects surrounding the creation of the National Cultural Center and the role the Kennedys played to make it a reality, which of course, contributed to the re-designation as the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.  The Roof Terrace is a very nice restaurant with the most friendly staff and an amazing view of the DC and Virginia skylines.  The only downside is the food is overpriced, in my opinion, for what you receive. The steak I ordered was really good and the lobster mac and cheese definitely did not skimp on the lobster.  The rest of our meal was good, but not at a level commensurate with the price.  You are definitely paying for the location; so just understand that going in.  I would like to re-state the staff were all very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed.  There is a full bar, beer, and wine available.  The selection was a little small, but diverse.  One other tip, reservations are pretty much a must.  I made a reservation as soon as I purchased tickets for a show, so it was months in advance and I did not have any issues with availablility.
