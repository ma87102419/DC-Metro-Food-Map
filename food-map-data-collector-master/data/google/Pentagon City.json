Walking up the cute little side drive and into the cozy space was nice. But it was all down hill from there. It was my first visit so I ordered things that were highlighted as restaurant specialties. The Calamari Fritti was not elevated in anyway. Basic at best. The Polenta Croccante was actually a great choice but my polenta was not crispy as described & that really took away from the dish. The Insalata Caprese was simple but it\u2019s described as over mixed greens but a romaine/spinach mix didn\u2019t sit right with me and I didn\u2019t pick up on any Italian red wine vinaigrette. But the biggest disappointment was the Risotto con Aragosta e Zafferano. Risotto is not a soup. I literally had a spoon full of liquid. And on top of that, it was flavorless. All I tasted was fishy seafood. We didn\u2019t even finish it. The staff & service was fine. We were seated next to 2 ladies who are regulars\u2026 So I assume there\u2019s potential.
