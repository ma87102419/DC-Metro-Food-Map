They are incredibly reliable in getting the food to us on time.  The food is always delicious.  There are many menu possibilities.  This dinner is very important to us  because it puts our bidders in an expansive and generous mood, and we can raise more money to give to local and international charitable organizations.  They have also catered holiday dinners for special occasions, and some informal lunches, for us.  Every time we have Kimberly's here, people rave about the food.  And they are easy to work with!
