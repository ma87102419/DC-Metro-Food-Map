I love, periodically (keep your health and diet in mind, people), getting a fresh, hot order of a quarter pounder with cheese, fresh fries, maybe a splurge on 3-for-a-$1 cookies here, an upcharge for a vanilla milkshake there... from a great McDonald's location.\n\nNow, admittedly, a good fast food experience sometimes depends on the location of the restaurant. Some of my more shameful experiences of McD's meals have, unfortunately, come from poorer areas where everything from customer service to excessive greasiness of the burgers were unjustly exchanged for a few of my dollars and a surcharge of my patience.\n\nThis particular McDonald's location, however, has consistently surprised me with a very close 1:1 ratio of \"ideal\" McDonald's quality (the kind of food you see in advertisements) with what you actually experience when you open the bag and eat. It's not always a picturesque match in visual presentation (the burger buns or patties are sometimes lop-sided) but, this location always seems to get heat and grease levels perfect which, in my omnivorous opinion, is more important.\n\nThe burgers here have never been overly greasy, the fries have been just the right level of crispiness, and the sodas and milkshakes have been at the higher end of McDonald's quality (as far as guilty pleasures go in quality, that is). Quality of food here comes highly recommended, so long as you eat your meal as soon after you order it as possible.\n\nIn terms of the cleanliness of this location, I've only experienced it as a closed-for-dining/drive-thru only location. Every time I've pulled the door handle, it's been locked (COVID times being what they are). That said, the drive-thru is relatively quick, the orders have been accurate, and the meals delicious.\n\nLastly, as an awesome money-saving bonus tip, I'd recommend downloading the app for regular coupons or deals for free food or skipping drive-thru lines. Or, if you don't want to do that but enjoy free quarter pounders with cheese (like I do), I encourage you to save your McD's receipts and fill out the quick online surveys to get the promo codes for a B1G1 deal on your next visit!\n\nLike I said, McDonald's is a guilty pleasure for me and this location has been great with drive-thru customer service and food quality. I'd recommend this location over others in the area. Eat fast food responsibly and in moderation (I know, I know, I've got two burgers pictured)! Bring coupons and deals for savings and extras!

Buttressed by Blackfinn Pub and Famous Toastery, a solid go-to movie theater right around the corner, and the brand spanking new metro station in Ashburn within walking distance.\n\nI came around noon, debating on brunch at FT or a quick-and-easy lunch at B-21, my fave local spot to grab a burger at. I decided to cast caution to the wind, and play shotgun roulette with B-21.\n\nI swung by here, and was presented with a near-deserted ambiance and a non-existent line. This place sorely needs more patrons, if you ask me.\n\nI rolled the 20-sided dice yet again, and went with the Steakhouse Black Pepper (#71) -- a limited time burger, and a likewise signature shake to go hand-in-hand with it -- the Triple Shot Espresso.\n\nAt the end, I was presented with one of those fancy flag things that flagrantly flew my order number -- #69. Right on, brotha. I would've preferred a digit higher though -- almost hitting the nail on the head, my fave number knocking right next door.\n\nWait was not bad. I chose one of those fancy, four-seater booths adjoining the window.\n\nMilkshake arrived first, with presentation on top-tier level. Black, chocolate-coated espresso beans with what looked like cinnamon sprinkled atop it. I had a few sips, and it truly hit the spot, on what felt like the warmest day in the cold, biting heart of Virginia winter.\n\nThe burger arrived later, shadowing the footsteps of the shake. Luxurious angus beef patty, Swiss cheese riddled with miniature holes that would even make a mouse proud, smoked bacon that skirted the edge of grandeur, and a brioche bun that provided the fitted icing on a medium-rare and well-seasoned cake.\n\nWhile I ate and drank my milkshake in the warm and languorous peace, I thought about my experiences, life choices, and a little of everything. I appreciate the peace that the atmosphere offered me, on a deep and altogether personal level.\n\nBurger, pretty solid and a home run in terms of presentation alone. Milkshake, never tried but a signature and unforgettable flavor.\n\nAll in all, solid experience at B-21.

Just went an hour ago and ordered 5 bobas, they were done in less than 5 minutes. Employees are super sweet and efficient. Very kind people and inside is very clean/well kept. Of course the boba here is great, their tapioca texture is just right. I recommend the matcha brown sugar.
