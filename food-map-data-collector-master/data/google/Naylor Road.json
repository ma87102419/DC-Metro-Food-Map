The spring roles look scary. I'm not sure what that is that is burnt inside of the ends. I know for sure that if the inside cabbage and vegetables (since veggies are full of water) is burnt then the outside should be too (since dough has less water in it than the veggies). Even if it isn't something weird in it, it is burnt! It is not okay to serve people burnt food any more than raw, undercooked food. I found a short strand of hair in the rice. The French fries had a decent texture but there were burnt pieces in it.\nThe orange sauce taste like orange juice mixed with oil and water. I have to say I'm torn about this. I usually find I can't taste orange in the orange sauce at places which not good either. But with this, it is all orange and no seasonings. It could use some celery, ginger, and peppers. Not much salt in it but the orange rinds are still in it. I do like that.\nThis is the food that gets cooked when training someone new or after the manager goes home for the night. I wonder if they actually stopped using seasonings because the  people there don't like it or to save money. Maybe they have the foundational knowledge of these dishes but not the whole recipes... Sigh. Maybe, I was looking for Thai style cooking...\n\nUpdate: I did eat the spring rolls after opening and investigating. The veggies inside were burnt because the wrapping dough broke open. I still say they should have redone them. I happen to like a little overdone for my food, and the extra oil penatration. However, that adds a lot of fat and calories.
