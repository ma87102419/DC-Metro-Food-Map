And I eat out a lot.  I\u2019ll provide more detail below for those who are interested.\n1) We were a group of 5.  4 of us showed up at 8p, and 1 more was going to join us at 8:30/45.  The first 4 of us sought to get drinks at the bar.  They encouraged us to grab our table and order with our waitress.  We took their lead and sat at our table.  Menus and water came, but then no one came back to take our drink orders.  They were just waiting for the 5th person to show up.  Understandable.  We went back to the bar after 10+ minutes to order drinks, they apologized profusely, and sent the waitress over right away.\n2) We then ordered drinks, including one for the person who had not yet arrived.  15 more minutes passed, and no drinks came.  Turns out they couldn\u2019t figure out the ingredients for one of the drinks, and instead of ask us OR bring the other four drinks, they just made us wait\u2026 until we complained again.\n3) Finally the drinks came and they took our food order.  After a decent wait (and, mind you, it was not that busy that night), they brought 3 of our 5 dishes out.  Those with dishes started eating.  The remaining two dishes *never came.*  After 10+ minutes of waiting, we complained again, they rushed to check with the kitchen, and then apologized (for the Nth time) that the orders had not been input correctly.\n4) We then ordered another round of drinks while waiting for the additional dishes to be made.  15+ minutes later, those drinks finally arrived.  We were steamed that they couldn\u2019t get anything right.\n5) When the burger finally arrived (one of the originally missing items), it looked great.  We had ordered it medium \u2014 intentionally not medium rare because we didn\u2019t want it all that pink on the inside.  The center of the burger was RAW BEEF.  In their rush to address the missing items, they severely undercooked the meat.\n\nNo other way to describe this experience than (a) HORRIBLE for us as guests, and (b) EMBARRASSING for them as a restaurant.  When you are an establishment with $34 entrees on the menu, we expect better.

However, the scallops had a rough texture to them. I\u2019m not exactly sure why they tasted rough/dry. Usually scallops have a soft, buttery taste to them. My cousin did enjoy the lemon caper sauce. I\u2019d say the sauce was enjoyable. We also ordered the crab cakes, please order with caution. They aren\u2019t lump crab, if you\u2019re a local. No pic because the dish did not look appetizing.\n\nReason I\u2019m rating this place a two is because I go to restaurants for more than ambiance. I go for food and service. The server was nice and knowledgeable. He neglected to inform me that he charged me twice after we requested a split check. My cousin paid and tipped in cash.

My only complaint is that 45 minutes into our dining experience, the manager came over and said that they were closing the store. It was 1:15 p.m. on a Sunday - we were not given any explanation for this sudden shut down. To say that this was bizarre is an understatement. We were given free pastries to make up for the inconvenience and were promptly shuffled out. 5 stars for the free goodies - 3 stars for the absolute pandemonium caused by people evacuating the building.\n\nUPDATE: After my party switched locations for continued studying, we walked passed the Panera approximately 4 hours later and it was OPENED.

We ordered the Turkey sandwich because it also came with homemade pesto sauce. I devoured it.\n\nNext we ordered the spinach and artichoke pizza and Italian calzone.\nThe toppings were flavorful and the calzones were soooo cheesy and pipping hot.\n\nFor dessert we ordered a slice of the chocolate cake. It was super thick and dense. With a little cannoli cream on top, it was a great end to our meal.\n\nI was very happy to support Angelico pizzeria. The owner is so nice and has multiple locations.
