I excused the first couple of bad customer service and went back but this time I WILL NEVER RETURN. Firstly, the employees at this location are EXTREMELY prejudice/racist. Most of the staff are from Latin descent and speak spanish and treat CUSTOMERS with black/brown skin poorly. I went in to pick up an order I placed online and when I arrived the woman who was making the orders didn't acknowledge me. I let her know that I was picking up an order and she still ignored me. This woman who appeared to be of Latin descent arrived after me and she acknowledged her right away and served her before me. She then asked me the name for my order and walks all the way in the back to look for it while it was in front of her face the entire time! Another instance was when I walked in to place an order and the employees making the food didn't understand what I was saying. She looked so annoyed and didn't even say hello. I said no lettuce and she proceeds to put lettuce in my food. I had her remove it but it was super frustrating to have to repeat myself and point at the food for her to understand. Also, there was a spanish speaking man behind me. When it was his turn to order she greeted him hello in spanish and made his food quickly. If you are going to have an establishment please train the employees to treat every single customer fairly. Racism, prejudice, and biases shall have no place in 2023! Come on people- this is utterly disgusting!  We are literally the reason your bills are paid! Also, train them to speak English. There is no reason why as a customer I have to figure out how to translate words in spanish for you to make my order correctly. Also, it's not fair or ethical to treat people with beautiful brown skin poorly. I recommend a diversity and inclusion training.

I have been frequenting them for several years. They have fantastic handmade dumplings that can be ordered uncooked, steamed or pan-fried for an extra $1.\n\nTheir noodle soups, cold noodles and salad dishes are all fantastic. But very often they can get heavy handed on the salt.\n\nMy favorite dumpling flavors are the fish & cilantro, shrimp & chive and Mama's Special. I wish they had more protein variations like tofu, chicken or lamb though.\n\nDining in was always a hit or miss, the service isn't always good. But during the pandemic, I've been doing mostly take out which has been easy. Their website prompts you to order through BeyondMenu and it's pretty self explanatory.\n\nPrices are super reasonable!", "time": 1625077651, "translated": false}]}]
