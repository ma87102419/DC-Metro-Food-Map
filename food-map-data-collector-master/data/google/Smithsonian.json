The seafood is particularly notable, with dishes like the crab cakes and seared scallops being favorites among diners. Additionally, the restaurant offers a selection of meat dishes such as the dry-aged steak and the lamb chops. The menu changes seasonally, so it's always a great idea to check the menu before going.\n\nThe service at Hamilton is top-notch, with the waitstaff being friendly and attentive.
