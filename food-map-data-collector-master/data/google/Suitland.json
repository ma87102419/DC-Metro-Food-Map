As I tried to tell her I want to order something else as well she totally ignored me and eventually responded and said come to the window. I, didn\u2019t understand why I needed to come to the window and have my order taken as others where placing their orders. Not to mention, there were several cars in front of me at this point so I left.\n\nAs I decided to leave and go to another McDonald\u2019s, I tried taking a photo of the rude female employee. When she saw me she laughed and walked away from the window and had a male employee assist the customers and never came back. She is definitely a poor representative of McDonald\u2019s and such behavior shouldn\u2019t be allowed or tolerated. She need to be removed from the drive thru and not allowed to interact with customers.\n\nI, decided to go another McDonald\u2019s on Chavez Lane and  the experience was totally different.
