Main St. for a while, and when we saw construction was completed, we stopped there for lunch yesterday. Friday, May 13, 2022.\n\nAs we're heading in, we passed a mature lady coming out, and I asked how it was.  She replied, \"Amazing!\" with a big smile.  Very nice endorsement!\n\nSal greeted us and got us seated right away. The decor is standard, but pleasant and comfortable.  I was impressed at how busy they were at 2:30PM, well after the lunch crowd.\n\nSal got our drink orders. I asked how the iced tea is and he asserted it is excellent. I agree wholeheartedly, it is excellent. Very nice and fresh.\n\nOur waitress, Tala was very pleasant and upbeat, with a good, helpful attitude. I've been dying for a good gyro in Roswell for a LONG time, so Jerry and I both got the gyro wrap with fries and Jerry additionally ordered an appetizer of stuffed grape leaves.\n\nI didn't have the grape leaves, but Jerry advised they were good.  The star of the show was the gyro. It is a generous size, with plenty of lamb and tzatziki sauce, served fresh and hot!  I rate this gyro a perfect 5 out of 5 stars.  The fries have some thickness to them, and they too were fresh and hot.\n\nI love Baklava, but my diet doesn't permit it. Jerry had some, however and said it was very tasty. It would have benefitted from heating about five seconds in the microwave to give it just a hint of warmth, but it was excellent overall and very tasty.\n\nFor my gyro, fries, and iced tea, I paid a very reasonable $11.38 plus tax. That's about the same cost as eating at a fast-food restaurant, but miles better!\n\nIn summary, this was an outstanding lunch experience and I highly recommend Sally's Cafe. I trust and hope they will enjoy continued success, as I intend to visit often.
