Both maki and nigiri were delicious.\n\nVibe: 3/5. Located in a small strip mall off Congressional, parking at Hinode can sometimes be tough. The strip mall has several popular businesses inside, so parking during peak times can be scarce. On several occasions we have had to street park on nearby side streets and walk to the restaurant. The inside of Hinode is your pretty basic sushi restaurant. Dozens of 4 tops and a large wooden sushi bar occupy the bulk of the main dining area. They have several rooms full of tables, so getting a table is usually quite easy, even for larger groups. The decor is a bit antiquated , but it is clean and they do have 3 very nicely maintained fish tanks at the front that are a joy to watch while you dine.\n\nService: 5/5. The staff have always been very nice and accommodating at Hinode. On our most recent visit for weekend lunch, service lived up to that expectation. We were seated immediately and given the all you can eat menus with our order taken promptly. Both the kitchen and the sushi chefs were quick in getting the food out and our waiter was on top of the beverage refills. Couldn't ask for a better experience .\n\nFood: 4/5. Before the pandemic, Hinode used to be a predominantly buffet style restaurant, offering sushi and Japanese/Korean food on the bar for you to take at your leisure. Post pandemic, they have transitioned to an all you can order style of dining, which in my opinion produces a better overall experience. The sushi comes out fresher and you are always guaranteed to get what you want. On my most recent lunch, the sushi was well prepared and generous in fish portion size. The hot foods were also exceptional, offering a delicious alternative to prevent sushi palate fatigue. The portion sizes for each sushi order are also nicely thought out (1 nigiri and 4 pieces per roll) so diners won't get full off of a single roll or 2. Overall, for the price of $23-30 depending if you down for lunch or dinner, Hinode is a great choice for sushioholics", "time": 1676313863, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Joseph Oh (Joe)", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103564209796511622131/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SZKVm4FBg0F10kE8zYd1GG5IXj0m3pUCi_XUptvQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "I've been looking for an AYCE sushi place ever since I moved here and I still haven't found one that does it for me.

If you bump it up to $35/person, you can order sashimi too, but I wasn't feeling that. In total, I got about 10 pieces of nigiri, 6 rolls, and 2 skewers of chicken.\n\nFirst off, I can understand AYCE establishments putting small amounts of fish with large amounts of rice, that's understandable, but at least make the rice taste good. It was colder than room temperature (you don't want sushi rice to be warm though) and kind of dry tasting. The fish itself was alright.\n\nThe chicken skewers were honestly really bad. The chicken had very little flavor and it was really hard to chew, almost like it had been overcooked.\n\nFor the money, you can definitely get a lot of food, but it's not that enjoyable.", "time": 1656040641, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "mike wittenburg", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112821563819565815648/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5RJZXQFSXCxfX8bDKJby1b0PWdJV3BbwcxMHsTtYQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "Five stars \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\nWhat a great deal, all you can eat Shushi, seven days a week!

The sushi rolls were so filling.  I recommend ordering the nigiri, and a limited amount of sushi rolls.  For those of you who don't eat much just order \u00e1 la carte.  A California roll without caviar is only $5.75.  pair that with miso soup and green tea and you have a meal for about $11.  A bargain!  Very large seating area and an area in the back you may reserve for large parties.  Take out service is popular.

It's not Italian food. Absolutely not. It's definitely very fresh ingredients but unfortunately got nothing to do with Italian cuisine. A shame that these fresh ingredients do not become an original italian dish. That's not a lasagna. That's meat with cream cheese divided by pasta plates. They just drizzle the tomato sauce on top of the lasagna so it is literally bathing in the tomato sauce. Mushroom ravioli were good. Not delicious but good. As long you do not expect to have Italian cuisine served, this place is quite ok. Pizzas were looking good. We will definitely try one of those next time.\n\nUpdate 9/26/2022:\nWow.
