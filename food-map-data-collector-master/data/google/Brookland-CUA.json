If you get a chance to stop in for a beverage and a show, you won't be disappointed.  D.C. isn't exactly a hotbed for good beer despite the number of breweries, but this place is an exception. Although limited in quantity, they certainly exceed others in quality. They have food available some nights from a pop-up kitchen in the back, and the space upstairs is very inviting and laid back.", "time": 1675093883, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Isaiah \u201cwIrd plEy\u201d Glover", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117084668799117368955/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5TIL2buRL2-p9BjofNWKZ7e7fLzC6A4eZSgAzTBdw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "I came here for an event.

I'm so grateful that I did. This is the kind of place that makes me hesitate to give it the great rating it deserves, because I'm afraid of it getting too busy and changing. But man, does it deserve it.\n\nYou cannot find new places this genuine. Bill (the brewer and DC born-and-raised) and his wife Kathy run an amazing little place that is as genuine as it gets, with spectacular beer (loved the Cream Ale best of what I had, but the Porter and the Rye IPA were both delicious as well), locally-distilled liquor and delicious veggie dogs (I tried the jerk plantain and the spicy eggplant/mushroom and I want more, but there's a Buffalo cauliflower still to try). Upstairs there was exceptional live music, but I didn't have the time to commit to it.\n\nIt's only open Fridays and Saturdays, but it's so worth it if you like value, excellence and authenticity. It's even better if you're in the neighborhood, because the clientele is mostly local and very friendly.", "time": 1557618652, "translated": false}]}]
