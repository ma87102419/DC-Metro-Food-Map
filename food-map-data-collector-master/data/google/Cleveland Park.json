Astetically, everything seemed to be fine. However, as soon as I ate my first peice of Uni I knew immediately that it was spoiled. So was the rest of the Urchin, badly. So spoiled u could smell it upon closer examination. The eal was lackluster but edible. Then I got to my California Rolls. The first two peices were edible, however the third had spoiled artificial crab meat. DO YOU KNOW how long it takes for that protein to spoil.??? A VERY VERY long time.!

Food was always half decent, if you know what to get. Then one time I saw the lady at the register take what was left of the soup that she was eating and pour it into another to-go container. She then packaged it into a brown paper bag with the rest of the order and send it off like nothing happened. She tried to hide behind the plastic so I wouldn't see, but that obviously didn't work. Needless to say I haven't been there since, but I wonder how many times I ate someone's leftovers.", "time": 1637469742, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Hwa Shi-Hsia", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575088688790308671/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5RnqhN6Ia5xnrNq8kvaxlDOWiuRwYYIH44UMiHAbw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "Kung pao chicken was pretty tasteless, just sugary.
