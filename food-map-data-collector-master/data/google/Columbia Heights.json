We got one of the combination platters, and some samosas. There was so much meat and veggies that we had to use extra injera for such. The only reason I am giving the place a 4 instead of a 5 star is due to the cleanliness. Some people mentioned flies, and I experienced such as well. Our table was also very sticky and required some additional cleaning prior to us being able to dine. When my friend and I went there, there was nobody else, maybe because it was early dinner time, so once again, I cannot relate too much with the service complaints. I have been to a couple of Ethiopian restaurants around the area, and I will recommend Dukem because it is one of those \"hole in the wall\" places where you can rely on for good food despite potential problems elsewhere.

The waitress said she would bring it but didn\u2019t - I asked again and then a third time. By this time we were 70% done with our food. The fourth time I walked up to the bar and asked again - she finally brought it out begrudgingly. All this while the other Caucasian tables around us were being served and asked if they needed anything / we were ignored.\n\n3- finally after waiting for another 20 minutes, we paid the bill at the counter - only for the hostess who had been extremely rude until then to charge a mandatory 18% service charge . I\u2019m not sure if this is a rule but their service did not warrant 18% and it was not communicated ahead of time.
