The steak is not too dry and the cheese is enough and melted good. Also their mumbo sauce too! I will never complain about this place because I always get good service and they always make the food how I wanted to be. I totally recommend this to anyone, you should TOTALLY try it especially if you like steak and cheese! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "time": 1624321306, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Monique Diop", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118113387804886836708/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5RNT2NHfUy7MDM9AVY8S0vqGmCd6Gtuyli9Se2f=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "yuck! stay away! went in and there was police tape INSIDE! cthu!

The honey mustard for the tenders must have been a teaspoon full. The steak was not fully cooked and my daughter was sick for two days. Cashiers are always pleasant. I question the other workers that work there now. They come from the back like they are mad to be there. I guess that is why I was served food like this.", "time": 1676318287, "translated": false}]}]
